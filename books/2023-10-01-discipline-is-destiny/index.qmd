*Publisher's Description*

The inscription on the Oracle of Delphi says: 'Nothing in excess.' C.S.
Lewis described temperance as going to the 'right length but no further.'
Easy to say, hard to practice - and if it was tough in 300 BC, or in the
1940s, it feels all but impossible today. Yet it's the most empowering and
important virtue any of us can learn.Without self-discipline, all our plans
fall apart. Here, Ryan Holiday shows how to cultivate willpower, moderation
and self-control in our lives. From Aristotle and Marcus Aurelius, to Toni
Morrison and Queen Elizabeth II, he illuminates the great exemplars of its
practice and what we can learn from them. Moderation is not about
abstinence: it is about self-respect, focus and balance. Without it, even
the most positive traits become vices. But with it, happiness and success
are assured: the key is not more but finding the right amount.
