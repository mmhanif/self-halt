I listened to the Audible version of this book prior to and during a family vacation to Venice. My daughter had read it previously and recommended it. I like reading novels set in places I am going to visit - it helps me get a feel for the place. This novel is definitely targeted at children but was not too childish to prevent adults from enjoying it. Recommended if you are going to, or have an interest in, Venice, but I probably would not have read it otherwise.
