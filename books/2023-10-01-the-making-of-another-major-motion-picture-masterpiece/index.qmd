*Publisher's Description*

From the Academy Award-winning actor and best-selling author: a novel about
the making of a star-studded, multimillion-dollar superhero action film . .
. and the humble comic books that inspired it. Funny, touching, and
wonderfully thought-provoking, while also capturing the changes in America
and American culture since World War II. Part One of this story takes place
in 1947. A troubled soldier, returning from the war, meets his talented
five-year-old nephew, leaves an indelible impression, and then disappears
for twenty-three years. Cut to 1970: The nephew, now drawing underground
comic books in Oakland, California, reconnects with his uncle and,
remembering the comic book he saw when he was five, draws a new version
with his uncle as a World War II fighting hero. Cut to the present day: A
commercially successful director discovers the 1970 comic book and decides
to turn it into a contemporary superhero movie. Cue the cast: We meet the
film’s extremely difficult male star, his wonderful leading lady, the
eccentric writer/director, the producer, the gofer production assistant,
and everyone else on both sides of the camera. Bonus material: Interspersed
throughout are three comic books that are featured in the story—all created
by Tom Hanks himself—including the comic book that becomes the official
tie-in to this novel’s "major motion picture masterpiece."
