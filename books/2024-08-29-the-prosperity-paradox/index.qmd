*Publisher's Description*

Clayton M. Christensen, the author of such business classics as The
Innovator’s Dilemma and the New York Times bestseller How Will You Measure
Your Life, and co-authors Efosa Ojomo and Karen Dillon reveal why so many
investments in economic development fail to generate sustainable
prosperity, and offers a groundbreaking solution for true and lasting
change. Global poverty is one of the world’s most vexing problems. For
decades, we’ve assumed smart, well-intentioned people will eventually be
able to change the economic trajectory of poor countries. From education to
healthcare, infrastructure to eradicating corruption, too many solutions
rely on trial and error. Essentially, the plan is often to identify areas
that need help, flood them with resources, and hope to see change over
time. But hope is not an effective strategy. Clayton M. Christensen and his
co-authors reveal a paradox at the heart of our approach to solving
poverty. While noble, our current solutions are not producing consistent
results, and in some cases, have exacerbated the problem. At least twenty
countries that have received billions of dollars’ worth of aid are poorer
now. Applying the rigorous and theory-driven analysis he is known for,
Christensen suggests a better way. The right kind of innovation not only
builds companies—but also builds countries. The Prosperity Paradox
identifies the limits of common economic development models, which tend to
be top-down efforts, and offers a new framework for economic growth based
on entrepreneurship and market-creating innovation. Christensen, Ojomo, and
Dillon use successful examples from America’s own economic development,
including Ford, Eastman Kodak, and Singer Sewing Machines, and shows how
similar models have worked in other regions such as Japan, South Korea,
Nigeria, Rwanda, India, Argentina, and Mexico. The ideas in this book will
help companies desperate for real, long-term growth see actual, sustainable
progress where they’ve failed before. But The Prosperity Paradox is more
than a business book; it is a call to action for anyone who wants a fresh
take for making the world a better and more prosperous place.
