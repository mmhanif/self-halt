*Publisher's Description*

An instant New York Times Bestseller! “Consider this another vaccine
against disaster. Fortunately, this dose won't cause a temporary fever—and
it happens to be a rippingly good read.” —Wired “This crisply written and
well-paced book reads like an all-caps warning for a world shackled to the
machines we carry in our pockets and place on our laps . . ." —The
Washington Post From two former military officers and award-winning
authors, a chillingly authentic geopolitical thriller that imagines a naval
clash between the US and China in the South China Sea in 2034—and the path
from there to a nightmarish global conflagration. On March 12, 2034, US
Navy Commodore Sarah Hunt is on the bridge of her flagship, the guided
missile destroyer USS John Paul Jones, conducting a routine freedom of
navigation patrol in the South China Sea when her ship detects an unflagged
trawler in clear distress, smoke billowing from its bridge. On that same
day, US Marine aviator Major Chris "Wedge" Mitchell is flying an F35E
Lightning over the Strait of Hormuz, testing a new stealth technology as he
flirts with Iranian airspace. By the end of that day, Wedge will be an
Iranian prisoner, and Sarah Hunt's destroyer will lie at the bottom of the
sea, sunk by the Chinese Navy. Iran and China have clearly coordinated
their moves, which involve the use of powerful new forms of cyber weaponry
that render US ships and planes defenseless. In a single day, America's
faith in its military's strategic pre-eminence is in tatters. A new,
terrifying era is at hand. So begins a disturbingly plausible work of
speculative fiction, co-authored by an award-winning novelist and decorated
Marine veteran and the former commander of NATO, a legendary admiral who
has spent much of his career strategically outmaneuvering America's most
tenacious adversaries. Written with a powerful blend of geopolitical
sophistication and human empathy, 2034 takes us inside the minds of a
global cast of characters--Americans, Chinese, Iranians, Russians, Indians
--as a series of arrogant miscalculations on all sides leads the world into
an intensifying international storm. In the end, China and the United
States will have paid a staggering cost, one that forever alters the global
balance of power. Everything in 2034 is an imaginative extrapolation from
present-day facts on the ground combined with the authors' years working at
the highest and most classified levels of national security. Sometimes it
takes a brilliant work of fiction to illuminate the most dire of warnings:
2034 is all too close at hand, and this cautionary tale presents the reader
a dark yet possible future that we must do all we can to avoid.
