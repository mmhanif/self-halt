*Publisher's Description*

A disgraced soccer exec reluctantly enlists the help of a retired soccer
star in coaching a children’s team in this small-town love story in the
vein of Ted Lasso and It Happened One Summer —from the New York Times
bestselling author of The Spanish Love Deception. Adalyn Reyes has spent
years perfecting her daily routine: wake up at dawn, drive to the Miami
Flames FC offices, try her hardest to leave a mark, go home, and repeat.
But her routine is disrupted when a video of her in an altercation with the
team’s mascot goes viral. Rather than fire her, the team’s owner—who
happens to be her father—sends Adalyn to middle-of-nowhere North Carolina,
where she’s tasked with turning around the struggling local soccer team,
the Green Warriors, as a way to redeem herself. Her plans crumble upon
discovering that the players wear tutus to practice (impractical), keep pet
goats (messy), and are terrified of Adalyn (counterproductive), and are
nine-year-old kids. To make things worse, also in town is Cameron Caldani,
goalkeeping prodigy whose presence is somewhat of a mystery. Cam is the
perfect candidate to help Adalyn, but after one very unfortunate first
encounter involving a rooster, Cam’s leg, and Adalyn’s bumper, he’s also
set on running her out of town. But banishment is not an option for Adalyn.
Not again. Helping this ragtag children’s team is her road to redemption,
and she is playing the long game. With or without Cam’s help.
