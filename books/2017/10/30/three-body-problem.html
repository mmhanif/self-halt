<p><strong>The Three-Body Problem (Remembrance of Earth’s Past #1)</strong> by Liu Cixin, translated by Ken Liu</p>

<p><em>Audible Unabridged, narrated by Luke Daniels</em></p>

<p>This book was recommended to me independently by a couple of different people. It was a definitely a highly thought-provoking and intellectual science fictional novel, originally written in Chinese, although listening to it you could not tell it was a translation. For me it dragged at points, especially the chapters set in the game or detailing events in the three-body world. The action on earth was much more compelling I thought.</p>

<p>This is part one of a three-part series. However, having finished (and, overall, enjoyed) the first book I didn’t feel in any rush to read part-two. even though I probably will at some point.</p>
