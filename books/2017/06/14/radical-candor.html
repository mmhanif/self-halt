<p><strong>Radical Candor: Be a Kick-Ass Boss Without Losing Your Humanity</strong> by Kim Malone Scott</p>

<p><em>Kindle</em></p>

<p>I first came across the author in a article describing the TED Talk she had given on the primary concept behind Radical Candor - that as a manager you need to both <em>Care Personally</em> and <em>Challenge Directly</em>. The article and talk resonated well with me but when the book came out I was worried that it really only had one great idea that would be repeated in different variations ad nauseum through the book. I was pleasantly suprised to found that the book had greater depth and a number of valuable lessons in it.</p>

<p><em>Part 1: A New Management Philosophy</em></p>

<p><strong>Chapter 1: Build Radically Candid Relationships</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Bosses guide a team to achieve results</li>
  <li>Manager’s three areas of responsibility:
    <ul>
      <li>Guidance: Create a culture of guidance (praise and criticism) that will keep everyone moving in the right direction.</li>
      <li>Team-building: Understand what motivates each person on your team well enough to avoid burnout or boredon and keep the team cohesive.</li>
      <li>Results: Drive results collaboratively</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>“It isn’t simply a matter of allowing your approach to your responsibilities to show that you care, however; you must also care deeply about people while being prepared to be hated in return.”</li>
  <li>‘Radical Candor’ is what happens when you put ‘Care Personally’ and ‘Challenge Directly’ together</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Chapter 2: Get, Give, and Encourage Guidance</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>‘Obnoxious aggression’ - when you challenge directly but don’t care personally</li>
  <li>‘Manipulative insincerity’ - when you don’t challenge directly or care personally</li>
  <li>
    <p>‘Ruinous empathy’ - when you care personally but don’t challenge directly</p>
  </li>
  <li>Radical candor: “Whisper: ‘Your fly is down!’ “</li>
  <li>Obnoxious aggression: “Shout: ‘Look, his fly is down!’ “</li>
  <li>Manipulative insincerity: Silent - worried about your feelings</li>
  <li>Ruinous empathy: Silent - worried about his feelings</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Chapter 3: Understand What Motivates Each Person on Your Team</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Superstar</em>
    <ul>
      <li>Steep growth trajectory</li>
      <li>Change agent</li>
      <li>Ambitious at work</li>
      <li>Want new opportunities</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>Rockstar</em>
    <ul>
      <li>Gradual growth trajectory</li>
      <li>Force for stability</li>
      <li>Ambitious outside of work</li>
      <li>Happy in the current role</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your job as manager is not to provide purpose but instead to get to know each of your direct reports well enough to understand how each one derives meaning from work</p>
  </li>
  <li>Excellent Performance: Keep your top performers top of mind</li>
  <li>Excellent Performance / Gradual growth trajectory: Recognize, reward but don’t promote</li>
  <li>Excellent Performance / Steep growth trajectory: Keep superstars challenged (and figure out who’ll replace them when they move on)</li>
  <li>Managing the middle: Raise the bar - there’s no such thing as a B-player</li>
  <li>Poor Performance / Negative growth trajectory: Part ways</li>
  <li>Questions to consider before letting someone go:
    <ul>
      <li>Have you given Radically Candid guidance?</li>
      <li>How is this person’s poor performance affecting the rest of the team?</li>
      <li>Have you sought out a second opinion, spoken to someone whom you truyst and with whom you can talk the problem through?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Common lies managers tell themselves to avoid firing someone who needs to be fired:
    <ul>
      <li>It will get better</li>
      <li>Somebody is better than nobody</li>
      <li>A transfer is the answer</li>
      <li>It’s bad for morale</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Low performance / Steep growth trajectory: Manager, look yourself in the mirror!
    <ul>
      <li>Wrong role</li>
      <li>New to role; too much too fast</li>
      <li>Personal problems</li>
      <li>Poor fit</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>No permanent markers: people change and you have to change with them</li>
</ul>
