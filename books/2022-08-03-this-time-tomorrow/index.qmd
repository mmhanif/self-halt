**Publisher's Description:**
"#1 NATIONAL BESTSELLER “The pages brim with tenderness and an appreciation
for what we had and who we were. I could not have loved it more."—Ann
Patchett “The kind of book that will make you laugh, make you cry, and make
you call the people you love. Exceptional."—Emily Henry "Delightful"—Boston
Globe "Poignant"—New York Times What if you could take a vacation to your
past? With her celebrated humor, insight, and heart, beloved New York Times
bestseller Emma Straub offers her own twist on traditional time travel
tropes, and a different kind of love story. On the eve of her 40th
birthday, Alice’s life isn’t terrible. She likes her job, even if it isn’t
exactly the one she expected. She’s happy with her apartment, her romantic
status, her independence, and she adores her lifelong best friend. But her
father is ailing, and it feels to her as if something is missing. When she
wakes up the next morning she finds herself back in 1996, reliving her 16th
birthday. But it isn’t just her adolescent body that shocks her, or seeing
her high school crush, it’s her dad: the vital, charming, 40-something
version of her father with whom she is reunited. Now armed with a new
perspective on her own life and his, some past events take on new meaning.
Is there anything that she would change if she could?"
