*Publisher's Description*

You are accused of a crime? Who would you rather decides your future - an
algorithm or a human? Before making your decision, bear in mind that the
algorithm will always be more consistent, and far less prone to an error of
judgement. Then again, at least the human will be able to look you in the
eye before determining your fate. How much fairness would you be willing to
sacrifice for that human touch? This is just one of the dilemmas we face in
the age of the algorithm, where the machine rules supreme, telling us what
to watch, where to go, even who to send to prison. As increasingly we rely
on them to automate big, important decisions - in crime, healthcare,
transport, money - they raise questions that cut to the heart of what we
want our society to look like, forcing us to decide what matters most. Is
helping doctors to diagnose patients more or less important than preserving
our anonymity? Should we prevent people from becoming victims of crime, or
protect innocent people from being falsely accused? Hannah Fry takes us on
a tour through the good, the bad, and the downright ugly of the algorithms
that surround us. In Hello World she lifts the lid on their inner workings,
demonstrates their power, exposes their limitations, and examines whether
they really are an improvement on the human systems they replace.
