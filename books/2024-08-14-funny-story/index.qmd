AN INSTANT #1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER! Named a Most Anticipated book of
2024 by TIME ∙ The New York Times ∙ Goodreads ∙ Entertainment Weekly ∙
Today ∙ Paste ∙ SheReads ∙ BookPage ∙ Woman's World ∙ The Nerd Daily and
more! A shimmering, joyful new novel about a pair of opposites with the
wrong thing in common, from #1 New York Times bestselling author Emily
Henry. Daphne always loved the way her fiancé Peter told their story. How
they met (on a blustery day), fell in love (over an errant hat), and moved
back to his lakeside hometown to begin their life together. He really was
good at telling it…right up until the moment he realized he was actually in
love with his childhood best friend Petra. Which is how Daphne begins her
new story: Stranded in beautiful Waning Bay, Michigan, without friends or
family but with a dream job as a children’s librarian (that barely pays the
bills), and proposing to be roommates with the only person who could
possibly understand her predicament: Petra’s ex, Miles Nowak. Scruffy and
chaotic—with a penchant for taking solace in the sounds of heart break love
ballads—Miles is exactly the opposite of practical, buttoned up Daphne,
whose coworkers know so little about her they have a running bet that she’s
either FBI or in witness protection. The roommates mainly avoid one
another, until one day, while drowning their sorrows, they form a tenuous
friendship and a plan. If said plan also involves posting deliberately
misleading photos of their summer adventures together, well, who could
blame them? But it’s all just for show, of course, because there’s no way
Daphne would actually start her new chapter by falling in love with her ex-
fiancé’s new fiancée’s ex…right?
