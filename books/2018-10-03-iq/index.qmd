IQ, Isaiah Quintabe, is the Sherlock Holmes of South Central Los Angeles. He even has his own (somewhat less reputable) Dr Watson in the form of Juanell Dodson. I really enjoyed the plot and the characters of this detective novel with a difference and look forward to reading the next book in the series.
