**Publisher's Description:**
"John Boyd was arguably the greatest American military theorist since the
sea power strategist Alfred Thayer Mahan at the turn of the 20th Century.
Best known for his formulation of the OODA Loop as a model for competitive
decision making, Colonel Boyd was also an original thinker in developing
tactics for air-to-air combat, designing warplanes, and the fluid, mobile
warfare known to the Germans as blitzkrieg and to modern armies as
"maneuver warfare." As much as anyone, John Boyd was the architect of the
two great campaigns against Saddam Hussein's Iraq, both the 1991 liberation
of Kuwait and the 2003 "March Up" to Baghdad by the U.S. Army and Marines.
But what of the costly, drawn-out insurgency that baffled the invaders once
Baghdad had fallen? In this short book, Daniel Ford applies Boyd's thinking
to the problem of counter-insurgency. Unlike the U.S. military in 2003, it
turns out that Boyd had indeed put considerable thought into what might
transpire after an effective "blitz" campaign. Indeed, he found many
similarities between "blitzers" and what he preferred to call guerrillas,
and he thought that they might be defeated by turning their own tactics
against them. This is an expanded version of a dissertation submitted in
the War Studies program at King's College London."
