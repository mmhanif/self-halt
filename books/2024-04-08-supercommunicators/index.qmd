NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • From the author of The Power of Habit, a
fascinating exploration of what makes conversations work—and how we can all
learn to be supercommunicators at work and in life “A winning combination
of stories, studies, and guidance that might well transform the worst
communicators you know into some of the best.”—Adam Grant, author of Think
Again and Hidden Potential Come inside a jury room as one juror leads a
starkly divided room to consensus. Join a young CIA officer as he recruits
a reluctant foreign agent. And sit with an accomplished surgeon as he
tries, and fails, to convince yet another cancer patient to opt for the
less risky course of treatment. In Supercommunicators, Charles Duhigg
blends deep research and his trademark storytelling skills to show how we
can all learn to identify and leverage the hidden layers that lurk beneath
every conversation. Communication is a superpower and the best
communicators understand that whenever we speak, we’re actually
participating in one of three conversations: practical (What’s this really
about?), emotional (How do we feel?), and social (Who are we?). If you
don’t know what kind of conversation you’re having, you’re unlikely to
connect. Supercommunicators know the importance of recognizing—and then
matching—each kind of conversation, and how to hear the complex emotions,
subtle negotiations, and deeply held beliefs that color so much of what we
say and how we listen. Our experiences, our values, our emotional lives—and
how we see ourselves, and others—shape every discussion, from who will pick
up the kids to how we want to be treated at work. In this book, you will
learn why some people are able to make themselves heard, and to hear
others, so clearly. With his storytelling that takes us from the writers’
room of The Big Bang Theory to the couches of leading marriage counselors,
Duhigg shows readers how to recognize these three conversations—and teaches
us the tips and skills we need to navigate them more successfully. In the
end, he delivers a simple but powerful lesson: With the right tools, we can
connect with anyone.
