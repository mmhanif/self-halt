This was a podcast in the form of an Audiobook. A very engaging story of a mysterious murder in remote West Cork, centered on someone who was quickly identified as the prime suspect but never convicted. As the story twists and turns at times you feel sure he did it and then with a new revelation doubts are cast so that you are uncertain again. I still can't make up my mind if he did or he didn't.
