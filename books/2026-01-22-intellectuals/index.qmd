## Introduction

In *Intellectuals* (1988), British historian Paul Johnson presents a scathing critique of the "secular priests" of the modern era—the writers, philosophers, and political thinkers who have claimed the moral authority to guide humanity. Johnson's central thesis is provocatively simple: there is a direct and damaging correlation between the private pathologies of these thinkers and the public philosophies they espoused. He argues that many of the most influential intellectuals of the last two centuries were "rotten to the core"—hypocritical, narcissistic, and cruel in their personal lives [1]. Johnson contends that because these individuals could not conduct their own lives with decency or integrity, their prescriptions for reorganizing society and human behavior should be viewed with extreme skepticism. The book serves as a historical warning against entrusting the moral direction of society to those who claim to love "humanity" in the abstract while mistreating the actual human beings closest to them [2].

## Overview of Key Points

Johnson constructs his argument through a series of biographical case studies, dismantling the reputations of revered cultural figures by exposing their personal failings. He identifies Jean-Jacques Rousseau as the archetype of the flawed intellectual [1]. Johnson highlights Rousseau's colossal vanity and masochism, but most damningly details his abandonment of his five illegitimate children to foundling hospitals, where they almost certainly died. This behavior stands in stark contrast to Rousseau's fame as the author of *Emile*, a seminal treatise on education and child-rearing [3].

The book applies similar scrutiny to other major figures:
*   **Karl Marx:** Johnson attacks Marx's scholarly integrity, accusing him of "crimes against truth" such as falsifying data to exaggerate working-class misery. Personally, Marx is depicted as an anti-semitic tyrant who lived in squalor, refused to pay his debts, and fathered an illegitimate child with his unpaid maid, Lenchen, whom he refused to acknowledge [3].
*   **Percy Bysshe Shelley:** The poet is portrayed as a "lifelong absconder and cheat" who left a trail of financial ruin and emotional devastation. Johnson emphasizes Shelley's callous treatment of his first wife, Harriet, whose suicide followed his abandonment of her [2].
*   **Ernest Hemingway:** Johnson dismantles the Hemingway myth, revealing him as a pathological liar who fabricated his war exploits and a brutal misogynist who dominated and discarded his four wives [3].
*   **Bertolt Brecht:** The playwright is depicted as a manipulator who exploited a "harem" of female collaborators to write his plays without credit. Johnson also notes Brecht's political opportunism, securing Austrian citizenship while serving the East German communist regime [3].
*   **Other Figures:** The book also levels critiques against Henrik Ibsen for his egoism, Leo Tolstoy for his "messianic" complex and cruelty to his wife, Bertrand Russell for his emotional coldness, and Jean-Paul Sartre for his support of totalitarianism [2].

## Overview of Key Themes

Across these varied biographies, Johnson identifies several recurring moral deficits that define the "intellectual" as a distinct historical type.

### Hypocrisy and the "Double Standard"
A primary theme is the vast gap between public pronouncements and private conduct. Johnson illustrates how these thinkers often exempted themselves from the moral standards they prescribed for others. They preached equality while exploiting servants, advocated for universal education while neglecting their own children, and championed truth while habitually lying about their credentials and research [1].

### Abstract Love vs. Concrete Cruelty
Johnson argues that a defining characteristic of these intellectuals was a professed love for "Mankind" in the abstract, which conveniently allowed them to ignore or abuse the specific individuals in their lives. By focusing on grand schemes for saving the human race, they felt justified in treating their wives, children, and friends with indifference or cruelty [2].

### The Messiah Complex
Many of the subjects are described as believing they possessed a unique gnostic insight that elevated them above ordinary people. This sense of intellectual superiority often led to a "messianic" conviction that they were entitled to reshape society according to their own ideas, regardless of the human cost or the practical consequences [3].

## Conclusion

*Intellectuals* is a polemical work that challenges the modern tendency to separate an artist's or thinker's personal life from their work. Paul Johnson concludes that the intellectual is often a dangerous figure—a person who cares more about ideas than people and whose arrogance can lead to disastrous social consequences. By exposing the "feet of clay" of these cultural giants, Johnson invites readers to be far more critical of those who offer themselves as the moral guardians of society. The book ultimately suggests that common sense and ordinary decency are safer guides for humanity than the grand theories of brilliant but deeply flawed individuals [1].
