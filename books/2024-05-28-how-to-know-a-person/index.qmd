NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • A practical, heartfelt guide to the art of
truly knowing another person in order to foster deeper connections at home,
at work, and throughout our lives—from the author of The Road to Character
and The Second Mountain As David Brooks observes, “There is one skill that
lies at the heart of any healthy person, family, school, community
organization, or society: the ability to see someone else deeply and make
them feel seen—to accurately know another person, to let them feel valued,
heard, and understood.” And yet we humans don’t do this well. All around us
are people who feel invisible, unseen, misunderstood. In How to Know a
Person, Brooks sets out to help us do better, posing questions that are
essential for all of us: If you want to know a person, what kind of
attention should you cast on them? What kind of conversations should you
have? What parts of a person’s story should you pay attention to? Driven by
his trademark sense of curiosity and his determination to grow as a person,
Brooks draws from the fields of psychology and neuroscience and from the
worlds of theater, philosophy, history, and education to present a
welcoming, hopeful, integrated approach to human connection. How to Know a
Person helps readers become more understanding and considerate toward
others, and to find the joy that comes from being seen. Along the way it
offers a possible remedy for a society that is riven by fragmentation,
hostility, and misperception. The act of seeing another person, Brooks
argues, is profoundly creative: How can we look somebody in the eye and see
something large in them, and in turn, see something larger in ourselves?
How to Know a Person is for anyone searching for connection, and yearning
to be understood.
