<p><strong>Publisher’s Description:</strong>
“Lincoln Lawyer Mickey Haller is back in the heartstopping new thriller from
#1 New York Times bestselling author Michael Connelly. Defense attorney
Mickey Haller is pulled over by police, who find the body of a client in
the trunk of his Lincoln. Haller is charged with murder and can’t make the
exorbitant $5 million bail slapped on him by a vindictive judge. Mickey
elects to defend himself and must strategize and build his defense from his
jail cell in the Twin Towers Correctional Center in downtown Los Angeles,
all the while looking over his shoulder–as an officer of the court he is
an instant target. Mickey knows he’s been framed. Now, with the help of his
trusted team, he has to figure out who has plotted to destroy his life and
why. Then he has to go before a judge and jury and prove his innocence. In
his highest stakes case yet, Mickey Haller fights for his life and shows
why he is “a worthy colleague of Atticus Finch…in the front of the pack
in the legal thriller game” (Los Angeles Times).”</p>
