<p><strong>An Economist Walks Into A Brothel</strong> by Allison Schrager</p>

<p><sup>isbn-13: 9780525533962</sup></p>

<p><em>Audible</em></p>

<p><strong>Publisher’s Description:</strong>
“Is it worth swimming in shark-infested waters to surf a 50-foot, career-
record wave? Is it riskier to make an action movie or a horror movie?
Should sex workers forfeit 50 percent of their income for added security or
take a chance and keep the extra money? Most people wouldn’t expect an
economist to have an answer to these questions–or to other questions of
daily life, such as who to date or how early to leave for the airport. But
those people haven’t met Allison Schrager, an economist and award-winning
journalist who has spent her career examining how people manage risk in
their lives and careers. Whether we realize it or not, we all take risks
large and small every day. Even the most cautious among us cannot opt out–
the question is always which risks to take, not whether to take them at
all. What most of us don’t know is how to measure those risks and maximize
the chances of getting what we want out of life. In An Economist Walks into
a Brothel, Schrager equips readers with five principles for dealing with
risk, principles used by some of the world’s most interesting risk takers.
For instance, she interviews a professional poker player about how to stay
rational when the stakes are high, a paparazzo in Manhattan about how to
spot different kinds of risk, horse breeders in Kentucky about how to
diversify risk and minimize losses, and a war general who led troops in
Iraq about how to prepare for what we don’t see coming. When you start to
look at risky decisions through Schrager’s new framework, you can increase
the upside to any situation and better mitigate the downsides.”</p>
