<p><strong>Orconomics</strong> by J. Zachary Pike</p>

<p><sup>isbn-13: 9780990859628</sup></p>

<p><em>Audible</em></p>

<p>I really enjoyed the storytelling and humor in this satire on modern-day
capitalism. I have never been into role-playin-games which is the genre this
novel is firmly based in, but seeing the Lord of the Rings movies as well
as Game of Thrones, was reasonably preparation for the book.</p>

<p><strong>Publisher’s Description:</strong>
“Professional heroes kill and loot deadly monsters every day, but Gorm
Ingerson’s latest quest will be anything but business as usual.The
adventuring industry drives the economy of Arth, a world much like our own
but with more magic and fewer vowels. Monsters’ hoards are claimed, bought
by corporate interests, and sold off to plunder funds long before the
Heroes’ Guild actually kills the beasts. Of course, that’s a terrible
arrangement for the Shadowkin; Orcs, Goblins, Kobolds, and their ilk must
apply for to become Noncombatant Paper Carriers (or NPCs) to avoid being
killed and looted by heroes.When Gorm Ingerson, a Dwarven ex-hero with a
checkered past, stands up for an undocumented Goblin, he inadvertently
singles himself out for recruitment by a prophet of the mad goddess to
undertake a suicidal quest. But there’s more to Gorm’s new job than an
insane prophecy: powerful corporations and governments have shown an
unusual interest in the quest. If his party of eccentric misfits can stop
fighting each other long enough to recover the Elven Marbles, Gorm might be
able to turn a bad deal into a golden opportunity.”</p>
