<p><strong>The Motive</strong> by Patrick M. Lencioni</p>

<p><sup>isbn-13: 9781119600459</sup></p>

<p><em>Hardcover</em></p>

<p><strong>Publisher’s Description:</strong>
“Shay was still angry but shrugged nonchalantly as if to say, it’s not that
big of a deal. “So, what am I wrong about?” “You’re not going to want to
hear this, but I have to tell you anyway.” Liam paused before finishing.
“You might be working hard, but you’re not doing it for the company.” “What
the hell does that mean?” Shay wanted to know. Knowing that his adversary
might punch him for what he was about to say, Liam responded. “You’re doing
it for yourself.” New York Times best-selling author Patrick Lencioni has
written a dozen books that focus on how leaders can build teams and lead
organizations. In The Motive, he shifts his attention toward helping them
understand the importance of why they’re leading in the first place. In
what may be his edgiest page-turner to date, Lencioni thrusts his readers
into a day-long conversation between rival CEOs. Shay Davis is the CEO of
Golden Gate Alarm, who, after just a year in his role, is beginning to
worry about his job and is desperate to figure out how to turn things
around. With nowhere else to turn, Shay receives some hard-to-swallow
advice from the most unlikely and unwanted source—Liam Alcott, CEO of a
more successful security company and his most hated opponent. Lencioni uses
unexpected plot twists and crisp dialogue to take us on a journey that
culminates in a resolution that is as unexpected as it is enlightening. As
he does in his other books, he then provides a straightforward summary of
the lessons from the fable, combining a clear explanation of his theory
with practical advice to help executives examine their true motivation for
leading. In addition to provoking readers to honestly assess themselves,
Lencioni presents action steps for changing their approach in five key
areas. In doing so, he helps leaders avoid the pitfalls that stifle their
organizations and even hurt the people they are meant to serve.”</p>
