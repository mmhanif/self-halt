<p><strong>The Second Sleep</strong> by Robert Harris</p>

<p><sup>isbn-13: 9780525656692</sup></p>

<p><em>Audible</em></p>

<p><strong>Publisher’s Description:</strong>
“From the internationally best-selling author of Fatherland and the Cicero
Trilogy–a chilling and dark new thriller unlike anything Robert Harris has
done before. 1468. A young priest, Christopher Fairfax, arrives in a remote
Exmoor village to conduct the funeral of his predecessor. The land around
is strewn with ancient artefacts–coins, fragments of glass, human bones–
which the old parson used to collect. Did his obsession with the past lead
to his death? Fairfax becomes determined to discover the truth. Over the
course of the next six days, everything he believes–about himself, his
faith, and the history of his world–will be tested to destruction.”</p>
