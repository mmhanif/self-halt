*Publisher's Description*

When one of their own is kidnapped, the washed-up MI5 operatives of Slough
House—the Slow Horses, as they're known—outwit rogue agents at the very
highest levels of British Intelligence, and even to Downing Street itself.
London: Slough House is the MI5 branch where disgraced operatives are
reassigned after they’ve messed up too badly to be trusted with real
intelligence work. The “Slow Horses,” as the failed spies of Slough House
are called, are doomed to spend the rest of their careers pushing paper,
but they all want back in on the action. When one of their own is kidnapped
and held for ransom, the agents of Slough House must defeat the odds,
overturning all expectations of their competence, to breach the top-notch
security of MI5’s intelligence headquarters, Regent’s Park, and steal
valuable intel in exchange for their comrade’s safety. The kidnapping is
only the tip of the iceberg, however—the agents uncover a larger web of
intrigue that involves not only a group of private mercenaries but the
highest authorities in the Secret Service. After years spent as the lowest
on the totem pole, the Slow Horses suddenly find themselves caught in the
midst of a conspiracy that threatens not only the future of Slough House,
but of MI5 itself.
