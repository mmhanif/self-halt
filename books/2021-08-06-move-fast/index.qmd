Short and somewhat insightful view into how Facebook develops software and has
overcome various market and technical challenges over the years.

**Publisher's Description:**
"Over the last fifteen years, every major aspect of our lives has changed
because of Facebook. You may not like Facebook, but you can't deny its
success. And to a large degree, that success stems from the "move fast"
ethos. The entire culture of Facebook is built for speed. Move Fast is an
exploration of modern software strategies and tactics through the lens of
Facebook. Relying on in-depth interviews with more than two dozen Facebook
engineers, this book explores the product strategy, cultural principles,
and technologies that made Facebook the dominant social networking company.
Most importantly, Move Fast investigates how you can apply those strategies
to your creative projects. It's not easy to build a software company, but
once you know how to move fast, your company will be prepared to build a
strategy that benefits from the world's rapid changes, rather than
suffering from them."
