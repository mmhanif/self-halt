*Publisher's Description*

· INSTANT NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER · The latest installment in the highly
acclaimed, internationally bestselling Strike series finds Cormoran and
Robin ensnared in another winding, wicked case. When frantic, disheveled
Edie Ledwell appears in the office begging to speak to her, private
detective Robin Ellacott doesn't know quite what to make of the situation.
The cocreator of a popular cartoon, The Ink Black Heart, Edie is being
persecuted by a mysterious online figure who goes by the pseudonym of
Anomie. Edie is desperate to uncover Anomie's true identity. Robin decides
that the agency can't help with this--and thinks nothing more of it until a
few days later, when she reads the shocking news that Edie has been tasered
and then murdered in Highgate Cemetery, the location of The Ink Black
Heart. Robin and her business partner, Cormoran Strike, become drawn into
the quest to uncover Anomie's true identity. But with a complex web of
online aliases, business interests and family conflicts to navigate, Strike
and Robin find themselves embroiled in a case that stretches their powers
of deduction to the limits - and which threatens them in new and horrifying
ways . . . A gripping, fiendishly clever mystery, The Ink Black Heart is a
true tour-de-force.
