> "From a communications perspective, the most important similarity among disparate individuals is the universal wish of human beings to be spoken to in a way which marries directness, concision and clarity with respect, politeness and courtesy."

Lot of useful tips in this book about how to use more precise language to get better results. Some of the examples feel very British but I think the advice is universal.
