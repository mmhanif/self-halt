*Publisher's Description*

From the bestselling neurosurgeon and author of Do No Harm, comes Henry
Marsh's And Finally, an unflinching and deeply personal exploration of
death, life and neuroscience. As a retired brain surgeon, Henry Marsh
thought he understood illness, but he was unprepared for the impact of his
diagnosis of advanced cancer. And Finally explores what happens when
someone who has spent a lifetime on the frontline of life and death finds
himself contemplating what might be his own death sentence. As he navigates
the bewildering transition from doctor to patient, he is haunted by past
failures and projects yet to be completed, and frustrated by the
inconveniences of illness and old age. But he is also more entranced than
ever by the mysteries of science and the brain, the beauty of the natural
world and his love for his family. Elegiac, candid, luminous and poignant,
And Finally is ultimately not so much a book about death, but a book about
life and what matters in the end.
