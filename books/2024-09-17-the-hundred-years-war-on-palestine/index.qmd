*Publisher's Description*

A landmark history of one hundred years of war waged against the
Palestinians from the foremost US historian of the Middle East, told
through pivotal events and family history In 1899, Yusuf Diya al-Khalidi,
mayor of Jerusalem, alarmed by the Zionist call to create a Jewish national
home in Palestine, wrote a letter aimed at Theodore Herzl: the country had
an indigenous people who would not easily accept their own displacement. He
warned of the perils ahead, ending his note, “in the name of God, let
Palestine be left alone.” Thus Rashid Khalidi, al-Khalidi’s great-great-
nephew, begins this sweeping history, the first general account of the
conflict told from an explicitly Palestinian perspective. Drawing on a
wealth of untapped archival materials and the reports of generations of
family members—mayors, judges, scholars, diplomats, and journalists—The
Hundred Years' War on Palestine upends accepted interpretations of the
conflict, which tend, at best, to describe a tragic clash between two
peoples with claims to the same territory. Instead, Khalidi traces a
hundred years of colonial war on the Palestinians, waged first by the
Zionist movement and then Israel, but backed by Britain and the United
States, the great powers of the age. He highlights the key episodes in this
colonial campaign, from the 1917 Balfour Declaration to the destruction of
Palestine in 1948, from Israel’s 1982 invasion of Lebanon to the endless
and futile peace process. Original, authoritative, and important, The
Hundred Years' War on Palestine is not a chronicle of victimization, nor
does it whitewash the mistakes of Palestinian leaders or deny the emergence
of national movements on both sides. In reevaluating the forces arrayed
against the Palestinians, it offers an illuminating new view of a conflict
that continues to this day.
