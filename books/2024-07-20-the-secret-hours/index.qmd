*Publisher's Description*

A gripping standalone spy thriller from the #1 Sunday Times bestselling
author of Slow Horses, with a riveting reveal about a disastrous MI5
mission in Cold War Berlin—an absolute must-read for Slough House fans. New
from the author of Slow Horses, now an Apple Original series from Apple
TV+, starring Gary Oldman and Kristin Scott Thomas. Two years ago, a
hostile Prime Minister launched the Monochrome inquiry, investigating
"historical over-reaching" by the British Secret Service. Monochrome’s
mission was to ferret out any hint of misconduct by any MI5 officer—and
allowed Griselda Fleet and Malcolm Kyle, the two civil servants seconded to
the project, unfettered access to any and all confidential information in
the Service archives in order to do so. But MI5’s formidable First Desk did
not become Britain’s top spy by accident, and she has successfully thwarted
the inquiry at every turn. Now the administration that created Monochrome
has been ousted, the investigation is a total bust—and Griselda and Malcolm
are stuck watching as their career prospects are washed away by the
pounding London rain. Until the eve of Monochrome’s shuttering, when an MI5
case file appears without explanation. It is the buried history of a
classified operation in 1994 Berlin—an operation that ended in tragedy and
scandal, whose cover-up has rewritten thirty years of Service history. The
Secret Hours is a dazzling entry point into Mick Herron’s body of work, a
standalone spy thriller that is at once unnerving, poignant, and laugh-out-
loud funny. It is also the breathtaking secret history that Slough House
fans have been waiting for.
