*ebook*

This is the third and presumably final book in the Dark Profit Saga - the first book, [Orconomics](../../books/2020-10-12-orconomics/) was really good, the second [Son of a Liche](../../books/2020-11-23-son-of-a-liche/) was great and Dragonfired is ... good. All the enjoyable elements from the first two characters are still there, and this books wraps up all the loose ends nicely but lacks the 'edge' of the previous two books. Still the series overall is excellent - well worth a read.

*Publisher's Description*

The monarch wants him dead. A dragon’s torching the realm. Is his heroic
gig about to be a critical catastrophe? Gorm Ingerson knows the king is a
fink. With the land’s insidious ruler hell-bent on his destruction, the
axe-wielding Dwarf berserker is desperate to beat him to the punch. But
when he discovers the rotten regent’s claim of a town razed by the world’s
richest dragon is false, the gruff adventurer fears there’s more than a
personal grudge at stake. Struggling to convince his old comrades that they
need to help him solve the mystery, the dwarven idealist stumbles into a
sinister smuggling ring. And with strange creatures, cunning assassins, and
vindictive bankers all plotting his demise, Gorm worries this time the
price of doing the right thing will be fatally high. Can he make a saving
throw against death with a high-stakes roll at disadvantage? Dragonfired is
the thrilling third book in the Dark Profit Saga satirical fantasy trilogy.
If you like witty banter, RPG references, and clever sendups of popular
tropes, then you’ll love J. Zachary Pike’s laugh-out-loud conclusion. Buy
