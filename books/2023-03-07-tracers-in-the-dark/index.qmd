*Publisher's Description*

From the award-winning author of Sandworm comes the propulsive story of a
new breed of investigators who have cracked the Bitcoin blockchain,
exposing once-anonymous realms of money, drugs, and violence. “A gripping,
stranger-than-fiction tale of how a small team of geeks and federal agents
cracked what was once thought to be untraceable cryptocurrency.” —Garrett
M. Graff, New York Times bestselling author of The Only Plane in the Sky
and Watergate Over the last decade, a single innovation has massively
fueled digital black markets: cryptocurrency. Crime lords inhabiting
lawless corners of the internet have operated more freely—whether in drug
dealing, money laundering, or human trafficking—than their analog
counterparts could have ever dreamed of. By transacting not in dollars or
pounds but in currencies with anonymous ledgers, overseen by no government,
beholden to no bankers, these black marketeers have sought to rob law
enforcement of their chief method of cracking down on illicit finance:
following the money. But what if the centerpiece of this dark economy held
a secret, fatal flaw? What if their currency wasn’t so cryptic after all?
An investigator using the right mixture of technical wizardry, financial
forensics, and old-fashioned persistence could uncover an entire world of
wrongdoing. Tracers in the Dark is a story of crime and pursuit unlike any
other. With unprecedented access to the major players in federal law
enforcement and private industry, veteran cybersecurity reporter Andy
Greenberg tells an astonishing saga of criminal empires built and
destroyed. He introduces an IRS agent with a defiant streak, a Bitcoin-
tracing Danish entrepreneur, and a colorful ensemble of hardboiled agents
and prosecutors as they delve deep into the crypto-underworld. The result
is a thrilling, globe-spanning story of dirty cops, drug bazaars,
trafficking rings, and the biggest takedown of an online narcotics market
in the history of the Internet. Utterly of our time, Tracers in the Dark is
a cat-and-mouse story and a tale of a technological one-upmanship. Filled
with canny maneuvering and shocking twists, it answers a provocative
question: How would some of the world’s most brazen criminals behave if
they were sure they could never get caught?
