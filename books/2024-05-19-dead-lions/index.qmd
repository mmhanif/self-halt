*Publisher's Description*

The CWA Gold Dagger Award-winning British espionage novel about disgraced
MI5 agents who inadvertently uncover a deadly Cold War-era legacy of
sleeper cells and mythic super spies. The disgruntled agents of Slough
House, the MI5 branch where washed-up spies are sent to finish their failed
careers on desk duty, are called into action to protect a visiting Russian
oligarch whom MI5 hopes to recruit to British intelligence. While two
agents are dispatched on that babysitting job, though, an old Cold War-era
spy named Dickie Bow is found dead, ostensibly of a heart attack, on a bus
outside of Oxford, far from his usual haunts. But the head of Slough House,
the irascible Jackson Lamb, is convinced Dickie Bow was murdered. As the
agents dig into their fallen comrade's circumstances, they uncover a
shadowy tangle of ancient Cold War secrets that seem to lead back to a man
named Alexander Popov, who is either a Soviet bogeyman or the most
dangerous man in the world. How many more people will have to die to keep
those secrets buried?
