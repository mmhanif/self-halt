*Publisher's Description*

A Wisconsin bookstore owner and cryptozoologist is asked to investigate a
series of deaths that just might be proof of a fabled lake monster in this
first installment of a new mystery series by USA Today bestselling author
Annelise Ryan. Morgan Carter, owner of the Odds and Ends bookstore in Door
County, Wisconsin, has a hobby. When she’s not tending the store, she’s
hunting cryptids—creatures whose existence is rumored, but never proven to
be real. It’s a hobby that cost her parents their lives, but one she’ll
never give up on. So when a number of bodies turn up on the shores of Lake
Michigan with injuries that look like bites from a giant unknown animal,
police chief Jon Flanders turns to Morgan for help. A skeptic at heart,
Morgan can’t turn down the opportunity to find proof of an entity whose
existence she can’t definitively rule out. She and her beloved rescue dog,
Newt, journey to the Death's Door strait to hunt for a homicidal monster in
the lake—but if they’re not careful, they just might be its next victims.
