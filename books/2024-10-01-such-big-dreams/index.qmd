*Publisher's Description*

A savvy former street child working at a law office in Mumbai fights for
redemption and a chance to live life on her own terms in this “smart,
haunting, and compulsively readable” (Amy Jones, author of We’re All in
This Together) debut novel about fortune and survival. “A page-turner of a
story that doesn’t shy away from exploring hard and painful truths about
the way people navigate the systemic conditions of society.”—Zalika Reid-
Benta, author of Frying Plantain Rakhi is a twenty-three-year-old haunted
by the grisly aftermath of an incident that led to the loss of her best
friend eleven years ago. Constantly reminded she doesn’t belong, Rakhi
lives alone in a Mumbai slum, working as a lowly office assistant at
Justice For All, a struggling human-rights law organization headed by the
renowned lawyer who gave her a fresh start. Fiercely intelligent and in
possession of a sharp wit and an even sharper tongue, Rakhi is nobody’s
fool, even if she is underestimated by everyone around her. Rakhi’s life
isn’t much, but she’s managing. That is, until Rubina Mansoor, a fading
former Bollywood starlet, tries to edge her way back into the spotlight by
becoming a celebrity ambassador for Justice For All. Steering the
organization into uncharted territories, she demands an internship for
Alex, a young family friend from Canada and Harvard-bound graduate student.
Ambitious, persistent, and naïve, Alex persuades Rakhi to show him “the
real” India. In exchange, he’ll do something to further Rakhi’s dreams in a
transaction that seems harmless, at first. As old guilt and new aspirations
collide, everything Rakhi once knew to be true is set ablaze. And as the
stakes mount, she will come face-to-face with the difficult choices and
moral compromises that people make in order to survive, no matter the cost.
Reema Patel’s transportive debut novel offers a moving, smart, and
arrestingly clever look at the cost of ambition and power in reclaiming
one’s story.
