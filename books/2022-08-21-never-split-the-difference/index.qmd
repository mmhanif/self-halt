*Audible*

I thought this was going to be one of those "one-idea" books that litters the broad self-help genre, but actually it was both entertaining as well as full of very practical tips. I used some of the tips in a negotiation in 2022 to good effect :-)

**Publisher's Description:**
"A former international hostage negotiator for the FBI offers a new, field-
tested approach to high-stakes negotiations—whether in the boardroom or at
home. After a stint policing the rough streets of Kansas City, Missouri,
Chris Voss joined the FBI, where his career as a hostage negotiator brought
him face-to-face with a range of criminals, including bank robbers and
terrorists. Reaching the pinnacle of his profession, he became the FBI’s
lead international kidnapping negotiator. Never Split the Difference takes
you inside the world of high-stakes negotiations and into Voss’s head,
revealing the skills that helped him and his colleagues succeed where it
mattered most: saving lives. In this practical guide, he shares the nine
effective principles—counterintuitive tactics and strategies—you too can
use to become more persuasive in both your professional and personal life.
Life is a series of negotiations you should be prepared for: buying a car,
negotiating a salary, buying a home, renegotiating rent, deliberating with
your partner. Taking emotional intelligence and intuition to the next
level, Never Split the Difference gives you the competitive edge in any
discussion."
