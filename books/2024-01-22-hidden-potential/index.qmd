#1 New York Times Bestseller “This brilliant book will shatter your
assumptions about what it takes to improve and succeed. I wish I could go
back in time and gift it to my younger self. It would’ve helped me find a
more joyful path to progress.” —Serena Williams, 23-time Grand Slam singles
tennis champion The #1 New York Times bestselling author of Think Again
illuminates how we can elevate ourselves and others to unexpected heights.
We live in a world that’s obsessed with talent. We celebrate gifted
students in school, natural athletes in sports, and child prodigies in
music. But admiring people who start out with innate advantages leads us to
overlook the distance we ourselves can travel. We underestimate the range
of skills that we can learn and how good we can become. We can all improve
at improving. And when opportunity doesn’t knock, there are ways to build a
door. Hidden Potential offers a new framework for raising aspirations and
exceeding expectations. Adam Grant weaves together groundbreaking evidence,
surprising insights, and vivid storytelling that takes us from the
classroom to the boardroom, the playground to the Olympics, and underground
to outer space. He shows that progress depends less on how hard you work
than how well you learn. Growth is not about the genius you possess—it’s
about the character you develop. Grant explores how to build the character
skills and motivational structures to realize our own potential, and how to
design systems that create opportunities for those who have been underrated
and overlooked. Many writers have chronicled the habits of superstars who
accomplish great things. This book reveals how anyone can rise to achieve
greater things. The true measure of your potential is not the height of the
peak you’ve reached, but how far you’ve climbed to get there.
