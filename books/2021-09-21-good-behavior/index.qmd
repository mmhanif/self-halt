*Audible*

Blake Crouch is becoming a favorite author. I really enjoyed [Recursion](../2019-06-19-recursion/index.qmd)
and [Dark Matter](../2017-02-28-dark-matter/index.qmd). Unlike those
two there is no element of science fiction here, but a still enjoyable ride
alongside ex-thief Letty Dobesh and her adventures.

**Publisher's Description:**
"Three interlocking novellas details the escapades of ex-thief Letty Dobesh
as she uses her skills to stop other crimes from taking place."
