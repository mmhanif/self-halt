The #1 New York Times bestselling WORLDWIDE phenomenon Winner of the
Goodreads Choice Award for Fiction | A Good Morning America Book Club Pick
| Independent (London) Ten Best Books of the Year "A feel-good book
guaranteed to lift your spirits."â€”The Washington Post The dazzling reader-
favorite about the choices that go into a life well lived, from the
acclaimed author of How To Stop Time and The Comfort Book. Somewhere out
beyond the edge of the universe there is a library that contains an
infinite number of books, each one the story of another reality. One tells
the story of your life as it is, along with another book for the other life
you could have lived if you had made a different choice at any point in
your life. While we all wonder how our lives might have been, what if you
had the chance to go to the library and see for yourself? Would any of
these other lives truly be better? In The Midnight Library, Matt Haig's
enchanting blockbuster novel, Nora Seed finds herself faced with this
decision. Faced with the possibility of changing her life for a new one,
following a different career, undoing old breakups, realizing her dreams of
becoming a glaciologist; she must search within herself as she travels
through the Midnight Library to decide what is truly fulfilling in life,
and what makes it worth living in the first place.
