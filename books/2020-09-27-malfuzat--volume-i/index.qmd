*Hardcover*

The *Malfuzat* are the collected sayings and discourses of Hazrat Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, founder of the [Ahmadiyya Muslim Community](https://www.alislam.org/library/ahmadiyya-muslim-community/), and recorded by his companions. Hazrat Mirza Ghulam Ahmad is known by his followers in the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community as the Promised Messiah and Mahdi. As the recordings of verbal discourse the language is a little less formal than the books of the Promised Messiah and thus form an easy to digest introduction to his teachings.
