*Audible*

I read this as part of my ongoing desire to understand why our society is becoming increasingly polarized and what we can do to understand each other better. A number of good takeaways from this book - for me the primary one was to avoid binary classifications that inevitably become "them and us".

**Publisher's Description:**
""In the tradition of bestselling explainers like The Tipping Point, [this]
book [is] based on cutting edge science that breaks down the idea of
extreme conflict--the kind that paralyzes people and places--and then shows
how to escape it"--"
