*Audible*

I loved this re-telling (more or less) of Mark Twain's *Adventures of Huckleberry Finn* from the point of view of runaway slave, Jim. The novel has a number of clever conceits, such as the idea that the slaves would speak to each other in regular English when there were no Whites around, but would switch to a pidgin-English in the presence of Whites. In Everett's telling Jim is educated and can read and write, a skill he hides from his slave masters. The novel lays bare the indignities of slavery and refutes the idea of there being "good slave owners".

The only thing I didn't really enjoy was the author's evident atheism showing itself in Jim's thinking. But that's probably a reflection of my own biases also. 

*Publisher's Description*

#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER - NATIONAL BOOK AWARD WINNER - ONE OF THE NEW
YORK TIMES BOOK REVIEW'S 10 BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR - SHORTLISTED FOR THE
BOOKER PRIZE - KIRKUS PRIZE WINNER - A brilliant, action-packed reimagining
of Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, both harrowing and darkly humorous, told
from the enslaved Jim's point of view In development as a feature film to
be produced by Steven Spielberg - A Best Book of the Year: The New York
Times Book Review, LA Times, The New Yorker, The Atlantic, The Economist,
TIME, and more. "Genius"--The Atlantic - "A masterpiece that will help
redefine one of the classics of American literature, while also being a
major achievement on its own."--Chicago Tribune - "A provocative,
enlightening literary work of art."--The Boston Globe - "Everett's most
thrilling novel, but also his most soulful."--The New York Times When the
enslaved Jim overhears that he is about to be sold to a man in New Orleans,
separated from his wife and daughter forever, he decides to hide on nearby
Jackson Island until he can formulate a plan. Meanwhile, Huck Finn has
faked his own death to escape his violent father, recently returned to
town. As all readers of American literature know, thus begins the dangerous
and transcendent journey by raft down the Mississippi River toward the
elusive and too-often-unreliable promise of the Free States and beyond.
While many narrative set pieces of Adventures of Huckleberry Finn remain in
place (floods and storms, stumbling across both unexpected death and
unexpected treasure in the myriad stopping points along the river's banks,
encountering the scam artists posing as the Duke and Dauphin...), Jim's
agency, intelligence and compassion are shown in a radically new light.
Brimming with the electrifying humor and lacerating observations that have
made Everett a "literary icon" (Oprah Daily), and one of the most decorated
writers of our lifetime, James is destined to be a cornerstone of twenty-
first century American literature.
