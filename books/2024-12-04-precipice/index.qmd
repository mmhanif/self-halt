*Publisher's Description*

Summer 1914. A world on the brink of catastrophe. In London, twenty-six-
year-old Venetia Stanley—aristocratic, clever, bored, reckless—is part of a
fast group of upper-crust bohemians and socialites known as “The Coterie.”
She’s also engaged in a clandestine love affair with the Prime Minister, H.
H. Asquith, a man more than twice her age. He writes to her obsessively,
sharing the most sensitive matters of state. As Asquith reluctantly leads
the country into war with Germany, a young intelligence officer with
Scotland Yard is assigned to investigate a leak of top-secret documents.
Suddenly, what was a sexual intrigue becomes a matter of national security
that could topple the British government—and will alter the course of
political history.
