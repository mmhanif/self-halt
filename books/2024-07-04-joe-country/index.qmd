*Publisher's Description*

If Spook Street is where spies live, Joe Country is where they go to die.
In Slough House, the London outpost for disgraced MI5 spies, memories are
stirring, all of them bad. Catherine Standish is buying booze again, Louisa
Guy is raking over the ashes of lost love, and new recruit Lech Wicinski,
whose sins make him an outcast even among the slow horses, is determined to
discover who destroyed his career, even if he tears his life apart in the
process. Meanwhile, in Regent's Park, Diana Taverner's tenure as First Desk
is running into difficulties. If she's going to make the Service fit for
purpose, she might have to make deals with a familiar old devil . . . And
with winter taking its grip, Jackson Lamb would sooner be left brooding in
peace, but even he can't ignore the dried blood on his carpets. So when the
man responsible for killing a slow horse breaks cover at last, Lamb sends
the slow horses out to even the score.
