*Publisher's Description*

For seventeen years, small-town public defender Andy Hughes has been
underpaid to look after the poor, the addicted, and the unfortunate souls
who constantly cycle through the courts, charged with petty crimes. Then,
in the summer of "2020", he's assigned to a grotesque murder case that brings
national media focus to rural Patrick County, Virginia--Alicia Benson, the
wife of a wealthy businessman, is murdered in her home. The accused killer,
Damian Bullins, is a cunning felon with a long history of violence, and he
confesses to the police. He even admits his guilt to Andy. But a simple
typographical error and a shocking discovery begin to complicate the
state's case, making it possible Bullins might escape punishment. Duty-
bound to give his client a thorough defense, Andy--despite his misgivings--
agrees to fight for a not-guilty verdict, a decision that will ultimately
force him to make profound, life-and-death choices, both inside and outside
the courtroom. With its unforgettable characters, insider's blueprint of
the justice system, intricate plotting, and provocative, no-holds-barred
ending, The Plinko Bounce demonstrates once again why Martin Clark has been
called "the thinking man's John Grisham" by The New York Times and praised
as "hands down, our finest legal-thriller writer" by Entertainment Weekly.
