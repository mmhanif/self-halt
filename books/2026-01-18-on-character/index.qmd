# My Take

This is more a series of vignettes rather than a set of coherent narratives. They were a mixed bag, some were poignant, some revealing, some dull. Overall worth reading but I personally did not get much new from his musings on character. 

Some of the vignettes left a sour taste in my mouth, such as his reflections on spending time with the IDF Golani brigade after combat in Gaza: "they weren't my soldiers but I was proud of them" he says. This is the same Golani brigade [responsible for the death of 15 aid workers in Rafah in March 2025](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafah_paramedic_massacre). I'm not sure this reflects well on McChrystal's character.

McChrystal narrated the audiobook himself in a somewhat slow stentorian tone. I bumped up the speed to 1.2x. There were numerous obvious edits in the narration that were very unartfully done.

## Introduction

In *On Character: Choices That Define a Life*, retired four-star General Stanley McChrystal offers a departure from his previous analytical works on leadership and history. Instead of profiling external historical figures, McChrystal turns inward to present a "memoir of ideas," exploring the nature of character through the lens of his own life experiences, successes, and public failures [1]. The core premise of the book is that character is not a static trait or an inherent quality, but rather a dynamic process shaped by choices. McChrystal proposes a defining equation for this concept: **Character = Convictions × Discipline** [3]. This formula suggests that character requires both deeply held beliefs and the rigorous will to act upon them.

## Overview of Key Points

The book is structured into three main parts, reflecting the components of McChrystal's equation: Convictions, Discipline, and Character.

### Part I: Convictions
The first section focuses on "Convictions," which McChrystal defines as the "mainsprings of action." He argues that convictions are more than just opinions; they are the deeply held beliefs that we embrace authentically, rather than those we merely inherit or adopt for social convenience [3]. In chapters such as "Opportunity or Opportunism" and "On Patriotism," the author challenges readers to distinguish between genuine values and temporary advantages. A key insight in this section is that true values are revealed not by what a person says, but by what they are willing to tolerate—and what they are not.

### Part II: Discipline
The second section addresses "Discipline," described as the "sinew" that connects convictions to character [3]. If convictions are the "why," discipline is the "how." It is the ability to follow through on one's beliefs even when it is difficult, inconvenient, or costly. McChrystal emphasizes that the most critical form of discipline is not just physical endurance, but the "Call to Think"—the mental discipline to think for oneself rather than accepting received wisdom. He also applies this concept to civic duty in the chapter "Fixing Politics," suggesting that discipline extends to how we engage with our communities and governance.

### Part III: Character
The final section synthesizes the first two into "Character," which McChrystal calls the "essential structure of our lives" and the "last full measure" of a person [1]. Here, the book becomes more personal and reflective. McChrystal discusses mortality, legacy, and the idea that character is never truly "finished" [3]. He shares candid reflections on his time commanding forces in Afghanistan and addresses his controversial resignation following the *Rolling Stone* article, using these events to illustrate how character is tested and defined by how one responds to failure [3].

## Overview of Key Themes

### The Equation of Character
The central theme is the interdependence of the equation **Character = Convictions × Discipline**. McChrystal posits that one cannot exist without the other; belief without action is hypocrisy, while action without belief is merely mindless routine. True character emerges only when these two forces are aligned.

### The Power of Mundane Choices
A recurring theme is that character is rarely forged in a single moment of dramatic heroism. Instead, it is built through thousands of small, unobserved choices made in daily life—how one treats subordinates, how one waits in line, or whether one keeps small promises [2]. These mundane decisions accumulate to form the bedrock of one's identity.

### Resilience and Accountability
McChrystal tackles the theme of failure head-on. By discussing his own public resignation, he illustrates that character is defined not by the avoidance of failure, but by the manner in which one responds to it. He emphasizes accountability and the resilience required to continue living with purpose after a setback.

### Us vs. Them
The book warns against the dangers of tribalism and the "They" concept, particularly in modern politics [3]. McChrystal reflects on how binary thinking erodes national character and urges a return to viewing political opponents as fellow citizens rather than enemies.

## Conclusion

Stanley McChrystal concludes that character is a lifelong pursuit that requires constant maintenance. He asserts that while we cannot control the circumstances of our birth or the "arc" of our lives, we have absolute agency over who we choose to be [3]. The ultimate judgment of a life is found in the private reality of one's character—"what God and angels know of you"—rather than in public reputation or awards. His final message is a call to action: to close the gap between the person we are and the person we are capable of being, ensuring that our "last full measure" is one of integrity.
