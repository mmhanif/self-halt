*Publisher's Description*

Drawing on advice from the world's leading experts on conflict and
communication--from relationship scientists to hostage negotiators to
diplomats--Ian Leslie, a columnist for the New Statesman, shows us how to
transform the heat of conflict, disagreement and argument into the light of
insight, creativity and connection, in a book with vital lessons for the
home, workplace, and public arena. For most people, conflict triggers a
fight or flight response. Disagreeing productively is a hard skill for
which neither evolution or society has equipped us. It's a skill we
urgently need to acquire; otherwise, our increasingly vociferous
disagreements are destined to tear us apart. Productive disagreement is a
way of thinking, perhaps the best one we have. It makes us smarter and more
creative, and it can even bring us closer together. It's critical to the
success of any shared enterprise, from a marriage, to a business, to a
democracy. Isn't it time we gave more thought to how to do it well? In an
increasingly polarized world, our only chance for coming together and
moving forward is to learn from those who have mastered the art and science
of disagreement. In this book, we'll learn from experts who are highly
skilled at getting the most out of highly charged encounters:
interrogators, cops, divorce mediators, therapists, diplomats,
psychologists. These professionals know how to get something valuable -
information, insight, ideas--from the toughest, most antagonistic
conversations. They are brilliant communicators: masters at shaping the
conversation beneath the conversation. They know how to turn the heat of
conflict into the light of creativity, connection, and insight. In this
much-need book, Ian Leslie explores what happens to us when we argue, why
disagreement makes us stressed, and why we get angry. He explains why we
urgently need to transform the way we think about conflict and how having
better disagreements can make us more successful. By drawing together the
lessons he learns from different experts, he proposes a series of clear
principles that we can all use to make our most difficult dialogues more
productive--and our increasingly acrimonious world a better place.
