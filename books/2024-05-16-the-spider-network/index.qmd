SHORT-LISTED FOR THE FINANCIAL TIMES BUSINESS BOOK OF THE YEAR The Wall
Street Journal's award-winning business reporter unveils the bizarre and
sinister story of how a math genius named Tom Hayes, a handful of
outrageous confederates, and a deeply corrupt banking system ignited one of
the greatest financial scandals in history. In 2006, an oddball group of
bankers, traders and brokers from some of the world’s largest financial
institutions made a startling realization: Libor—the London interbank
offered rate, which determines interest rates on trillions in loans
worldwide—was set daily by a small group of easily manipulated
functionaries. Tom Hayes, a brilliant but troubled mathematician, became
the lynchpin of shadowy team that used hook and crook to take over the
process and set rates that made them a fortune, no matter the cost to
others. Among the motley crew was a French trader nicknamed “Gollum”; the
broker “Abbo,” who liked to publicly strip naked when drinking; a Kazakh
chicken farmer turned something short of financial whiz kid; an executive
called “Clumpy” because of his patchwork hair loss; and a broker
uncreatively nicknamed “Big Nose.” Eventually known as the “Spider
Network,” Hayes’s circle generated untold riches —until it all unraveled in
spectacularly vicious, backstabbing fashion. Praised as reading “like a
fast-paced John le Carré thriller” (New York Times), “compelling”
(Washington Post) and “jaw-dropping” (Financial Times), The Spider Network
is not only a rollicking account of the scam, but a provocative examination
of a financial system that was warped and shady throughout.
