The subtitle is "Dispatches from a Precarious State" and this one of many similar
books over the years from foreign journalists detailing the seemingly continually
precarious state of Pakistan, e.g. [Breaking the Curfew](https://www.amazon.com/Breaking-Curfew-Political-Journey-Pakistan/dp/071812989X), [Waiting for Allah](https://www.amazon.com/Waiting-Allah-Pakistans-struggle-democracy/dp/0241130557)
and [Pakistan: A Hard Country](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1610391454).

This book does not paint a very positive picture of Pakistan, but does show some
of the complexity of politics and culture in the country. Each chapter is focused
on a different person - the "nine lives":

1. Red Zone: The Reluctant Fundamentalist - Abdul Rashid Ghazi, leader of Red Mosque
2. The Prodigal Father: Jinnah's Pakistan - Mohammad Ali Jinnah, founder of Pakistan
3. Arithmetic on the Frontier: A Pashtun Takes On the Taliban - Anwar Kamal Khan, Pashtun Politician
4. The Fabulous Senorita: A Human Rights Heroine Versus the Generals - Asma Jahangir, human-rights lawyer
5. The Good Muslim: A Millionaire's Crusade - Salman Taseer, Punjabi businessman and politician
6. Lost in Waziristan: A Veteran Spy Miscalculates - Sultan Amir Tarar (Colonel Imam), retired ISI official
7. Minimum City: Faith in God and Glock - Chaudhary Aslam Khan, Karachi super cop
8. War of the Flea: Balochistan's Fifth Rebellion - Nawab Akbar Khan Bugti, Balochi rebel leader
9. Undesirable Activities: A Spy Comes Clean - "Ashraf" an ISI officer

**Publisher's Description:**
"Declan Walsh's electrifying portrait of Pakistan after 9/11 captures the
sweep of this "strange, wondrous and benighted country" through the
dramatic lives of nine fascinating individuals. On assignment for the New
York Times and other outlets, Walsh traveled from the raucous port of
Karachi to the salons of Lahore, and from Baluchistan to the mountains of
Waziristan. He met a diverse cast of extraordinary Pakistanis--a chieftain
readying for war at his desert fort, a retired spy skulking through the
borderlands, and a crusading lawyer risking death for her beliefs, among
others. Unbeknownst to Walsh, an intelligence agent was tracking him.
Written in the aftermath of Walsh's dramatic deportation, The Nine Lives of
Pakistan concludes with an astonishing encounter with that agent, and his
revelations about Pakistan's powerful security state. Intimate and complex,
attuned to the centrifugal forces of history, identity, and faith, The Nine
Lives of Pakistan offers an unflinching account of life in a precarious,
vital country."
