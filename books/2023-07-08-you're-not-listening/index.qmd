*Publisher's Description*

When was the last time you listened to someone, or someone really listened
to you? "If you’re like most people, you don’t listen as often or as well
as you’d like. There’s no one better qualified than a talented journalist
to introduce you to the right mindset and skillset—and this book does it
with science and humor." -Adam Grant, #1 New York Times bestselling author
of Originals and Give and Take "An essential book for our times." -Lori
Gottlieb, New York Times bestselling author of Maybe You Should Talk to
Someone At work, we’re taught to lead the conversation. On social media, we
shape our personal narratives. At parties, we talk over one another. So do
our politicians. We’re not listening. And no one is listening to us.
Despite living in a world where technology allows constant digital
communication and opportunities to connect, it seems no one is really
listening or even knows how. And it’s making us lonelier, more isolated,
and less tolerant than ever before. A listener by trade, New York Times
contributor Kate Murphy wanted to know how we got here. In this always
illuminating and often humorous deep dive, Murphy explains why we’re not
listening, what it’s doing to us, and how we can reverse the trend. She
makes accessible the psychology, neuroscience, and sociology of listening
while also introducing us to some of the best listeners out there
(including a CIA agent, focus group moderator, bartender, radio producer,
and top furniture salesman). Equal parts cultural observation, scientific
exploration, and rousing call to action that's full of practical advice,
You're Not Listening is to listening what Susan Cain's Quiet was to
introversion. It’s time to stop talking and start listening.
