*Publisher's Description*

Wall Street Journal Bestseller From the acclaimed author of Turn the Ship
Around!, former US Navy Captain David Marquet, comes a radical new playbook
for empowering your team to make better decisions and take greater
ownership. You might imagine that an effective leader is someone who makes
quick, intelligent decisions, gives inspiring speeches, and issues clear
orders to their team so they can execute a plan to achieve your
organization's goals. Unfortunately, David Marquet argues, that's an
outdated model of leadership that just doesn't work anymore. As a leader in
today's networked, information-dense business climate, you don't have full
visibility into your organization or the ground reality of your operating
environment. In order to harness the eyes, ears, and minds of your people,
you need to foster a climate of collaborative experimentation that
encourages people to speak up when they notice problems and work together
to identify and test solutions. Too many leaders fall in love with the
sound of their own voice, and wind up dictating plans and digging in their
heels when problems begin to emerge. Even when you want to be a more
collaborative leader, you can undermine your own efforts by defaulting to
command-and-control language we've inherited from the industrial era. It's
time to ditch the industrial age playbook of leadership. In Leadership is
Language, you'll learn how choosing your words can dramatically improve
decision-making and execution on your team. Marquet outlines six plays for
all leaders, anchored in how you use language: • Control the clock, don't
obey the clock: Pre-plan decision points and give your people the tools
they need to hit pause on a plan of action if they notice something wrong.
• Collaborate, don't coerce: As the leader, you should be the last one to
offer your opinion. Rather than locking your team into binary responses
("Is this a good plan?"), allow them to answer on a scale ("How confident
are you about this plan?") • Commit, don't comply: Rather than expect your
team to comply with specific directions, explain your overall goals, and
get their commitment to achieving it one piece at a time. • Complete, not
continue: If every day feels like a repetition of the last, you're doing
something wrong. Articulate concrete plans with a start and end date to
align your team. • Improve, don't prove: Ask your people to improve on
plans and processes, rather than prove that they can meet fixed goals or
deadlines. You'll face fewer cut corners and better long-term results. •
Connect, don't conform: Flatten hierarchies in your organization and
connect with your people to encourage them to contribute to decision-
making. In his last book, Turn the Ship Around!, Marquet told the
incredible story of abandoning command-and-control leadership on his
submarine and empowering his crew to turn the worst performing submarine to
the best performer in the fleet. Now, with Leadership is Language he gives
businesspeople the tools they need to achieve such transformational
leadership in their organizations.
