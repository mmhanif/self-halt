I listened to the audiobook of Paul Murray's preious book, *Skippy Dies*, a few years ago and absolutely loved it. The writing was wonderful but the full cast reading of the audiobook was truly stellar.

I got the audiobook version of *The Mark and the Void* and was a little disappointed to see (hear?) that there was only a single narrator. Luckily, he turned out to be very good. The book is set in post-financial crisis Dublin, but a Dublin almost stripped of it's Irishness and populated by a multinational jet-set elite who never venture far from the International Finacial Center district. There's lots of biting criticism here of the excesses of the financial world both pre and post-crisis. The story is more of a farce than I remember *Skippy Dies* being and didn't quite hit the hights of that book for me. Still all in all, enjoyable read.
