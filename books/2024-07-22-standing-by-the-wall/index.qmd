*Publisher's Description*

At last in one volume: the collected Slough House spy novellas, including
the never-before-published Christmas interlude Standing by the Wall.
Espionage. Blackmail. Revenge. Cunning. Slapstick. State secrets dating
back to the fall of the Berlin Wall. All this and more in a tight package
of five novellas by Mick Herron, CWA Gold Dagger–winning author of Slow
Horses. From the troubled recruitment of a new MI5 informant to a botched
information transfer, Herron’s novellas capture the drama, humor, and high
stakes of everyday life in the world of spycraft, a world rife with both
legends and secrets, where thrill-seeking and loneliness are ubiquitous and
deadly, and where the lines between friends, enemies, and lovers are
perpetually blurred by circumstance and subterfuge. For fans new and old,
Standing by the Wall is an excellent introduction to the extended literary
universe of Mick Herron’s Slow Horses. Collection includes: The List, The
Marylebone Drop, The Catch, The Last Dead Letter, and Standing by the Wall.
