INSTANT NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER “A new masterpiece from one of my
favorite authors… [How The World Really Works] is a compelling and highly
readable book that leaves readers with the fundamental grounding needed to
help solve the world’s toughest challenges.”—Bill Gates “Provocative but
perceptive . . . You can agree or disagree with Smil—accept or doubt his
‘just the facts’ posture—but you probably shouldn’t ignore him.”—The
Washington Post An essential analysis of the modern science and technology
that makes our twenty-first century lives possible—a scientist's
investigation into what science really does, and does not, accomplish. We
have never had so much information at our fingertips and yet most of us
don’t know how the world really works. This book explains seven of the most
fundamental realities governing our survival and prosperity. From energy
and food production, through our material world and its globalization, to
risks, our environment and its future, How the World Really Works offers a
much-needed reality check—because before we can tackle problems
effectively, we must understand the facts. In this ambitious and thought-
provoking book we see, for example, that globalization isn’t inevitable—the
foolishness of allowing 70 per cent of the world’s rubber gloves to be made
in just one factory became glaringly obvious in 2020—and that our societies
have been steadily increasing their dependence on fossil fuels, such that
any promises of decarbonization by 2050 are a fairy tale. For example, each
greenhouse-grown supermarket-bought tomato has the equivalent of five
tablespoons of diesel embedded in its production, and we have no way of
producing steel, cement or plastics at required scales without huge carbon
emissions. Ultimately, Smil answers the most profound question of our age:
are we irrevocably doomed or is a brighter utopia ahead? Compelling, data-
rich and revisionist, this wonderfully broad, interdisciplinary guide finds
faults with both extremes. Looking at the world through this quantitative
lens reveals hidden truths that change the way we see our past, present and
uncertain future.
