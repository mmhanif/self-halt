*Audible*

A book with a unique premise - the narrator is the highly precocious but as yet
unborn child still in the womb of one of the main charachters, Trudy. He hears
everything that Trudy does and experiences everything she eats and drink,
developing a taste of red wine.

Worth reading if only for the uniqueness of the viewpoint but it does drag on
towards the end, and none of the characters are particularly likeable.

**Publisher's Description:**
"**The Number One Sunday Times bestseller** A Daily Telegraph / Guardian /
Irish Times / Spectator / Sunday Times / The Times Book of the Year Trudy
has betrayed her husband, John. She's still in the marital home - a
dilapidated, priceless London townhouse - but not with John. Instead, she's
with his brother, the profoundly banal Claude, and the two of them have a
plan. But there is a witness to their plot: the inquisitive, nine-month-old
resident of Trudy's womb. Told from a perspective unlike any other,
Nutshell is a classic tale of murder and deceit from one of the world's
master storytellers."
