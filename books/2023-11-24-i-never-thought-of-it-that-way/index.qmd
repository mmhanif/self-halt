PORCHLIGHT BOOKS JUNE 2022 NONFICTION BESTSELLER “I can see this book
helping estranged parties who are equally invested in bridging a gap—it
could be assigned reading for fractured families aspiring to a harmonious
Thanksgiving dinner.” —New York Times “Like all skills, these techniques
take practice. But anyone who sincerely wants to bridge the gaps in
understanding will appreciate this book. Guzmán is emphatic about making an
effort to work on difficult conversations.” —Manhattan Book Review We think
we have the answers, but we need to be asking a lot more questions.
Journalist Mónica Guzmán is the loving liberal daughter of Mexican
immigrants who voted—twice—for Donald Trump. When the country could no
longer see straight across the political divide, Mónica set out to find
what was blinding us and discovered the most eye-opening tool we’re not
using: our own built-in curiosity. Partisanship is up, trust is down, and
our social media feeds make us sure we’re right and everyone else is
ignorant (or worse). But avoiding one another is hurting our relationships
and our society. In this timely, personal guide, Mónica, the chief
storyteller for the national cross-partisan depolarization organization
Braver Angels, takes you to the real front lines of a crisis that threatens
to grind America to a halt—broken conversations among confounded people.
She shows you how to overcome the fear and certainty that surround us to
finally do what only seems impossible: understand and even learn from
people in your life whose whole worldview is different from or even opposed
to yours. Drawing from cross-partisan conversations she’s had, organized,
or witnessed everywhere from the echo chambers on social media to the wheat
fields in Oregon to raw, unfiltered fights with her own family on election
night, Mónica shows how you can put your natural sense of wonder to work
for you immediately, finding the answers you need by talking with
people—rather than about them—and asking the questions you want, curiously.
In these pages, you’ll learn: How to ask what you really want to know (even
if you’re afraid to) How to grow smarter from even the most tense
interactions, online or off How to cross boundaries and find common
ground—with anyone Whether you’re left, right, center, or not a fan of
labels: If you’re ready to fight back against the confusion, heartbreak,
and madness of our dangerously divided times—in your own life, at
least—Mónica’s got the tools and fresh, surprising insights to prove that
seeing where people are coming from isn’t just possible. It’s easier than
you think.
