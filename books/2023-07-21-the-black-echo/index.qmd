*Publisher's Description*

START HERE: The first book in the Bosch series! For maverick LAPD homicide
detective Harry Bosch, the body in the drainpipe at Mulholland Dam is more
than another anonymous statistic. This one is personal...because the
murdered man was a fellow Vietnam "tunnel rat" who had fought side by side
with him in a hellish underground war. Now Bosch is about to relive the
horror of Nam. From a dangerous maze of blind alleys to a daring criminal
heist beneath the city, his survival instincts will once again be tested to
their limit. Pitted against enemies inside his own department and forced to
make the agonizing choice between justice and vengeance, Bosch goes on the
hunt for a killer whose true face will shock him.
