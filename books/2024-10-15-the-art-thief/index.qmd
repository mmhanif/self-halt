#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • One of the most remarkable true-crime
narratives of the twenty-first century • “The Art Thief, like its title
character, has confidence, élan, and a great sense of timing."—The New
Yorker A BEST BOOK OF THE YEAR: The Washington Post, The New Yorker, Lit
Hub "Enthralling." —The Wall Street Journal Stéphane Bréitwieser is the
most prolific art thief of all time. He pulled off more than 200 heists,
often in crowded museums in broad daylight. His girlfriend served as his
accomplice. His collection was worth an estimated $2 billion. He never sold
a piece, displaying his stolen art in his attic bedroom. He felt like a
king. Until everything came to a shocking end. In this spellbinding
portrait of obsession and flawed genius, Michael Finkel gives us one of the
most remarkable true-crime narratives of our times, a riveting story of
art, theft, love, and an insatiable hunger to possess beauty at any cost.
