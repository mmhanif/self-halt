“One of the 12 best business books of all time…. Timeless principles of
empowering leadership.” – USA Today "The best how-to manual anywhere for
managers on delegating, training, and driving flawless execution.” —FORTUNE
Since Turn the Ship Around! was published in 2013, hundreds of thousands of
readers have been inspired by former Navy captain David Marquet’s true
story. Many have applied his insights to their own organizations, creating
workplaces where everyone takes responsibility for his or her actions,
where followers grow to become leaders, and where happier teams drive
dramatically better results. Marquet was a Naval Academy graduate and an
experienced officer when selected for submarine command. Trained to give
orders in the traditional model of “know all–tell all” leadership, he faced
a new wrinkle when he was shifted to the Santa Fe, a nuclear-powered
submarine. Facing the high-stress environment of a sub where there’s little
margin for error, he was determined to reverse the trends he found on the
Santa Fe: poor morale, poor performance, and the worst retention rate in
the fleet. Almost immediately, Marquet ran into trouble when he unknowingly
gave an impossible order, and his crew tried to follow it anyway. When he
asked why, the answer was: “Because you told me to.” Marquet realized that
while he had been trained for a different submarine, his crew had been
trained to do what they were told—a deadly combination. That’s when Marquet
flipped the leadership model on its head and pushed for leadership at every
level. Turn the Ship Around! reveals how the Santa Fe skyrocketed from
worst to first in the fleet by challenging the U.S. Navy’s traditional
leader-follower approach. Struggling against his own instincts to take
control, he instead achieved the vastly more powerful model of giving
control to his subordinates, and creating leaders. Before long, each member
of Marquet’s crew became a leader and assumed responsibility for everything
he did, from clerical tasks to crucial combat decisions. The crew became
completely engaged, contributing their full intellectual capacity every
day. The Santa Fe set records for performance, morale, and retention. And
over the next decade, a highly disproportionate number of the officers of
the Santa Fe were selected to become submarine commanders. Whether you need
a major change of course or just a tweak of the rudder, you can apply
Marquet’s methods to turn your own ship around.
