<p><strong>Andrea Vernon and the Big Axe Acquisition</strong> by</p>

<p><sup>ASIN: B0944QNLV1</sup></p>

<p><em>Audible</em></p>

<p><strong>Publisher’s Description:</strong>
“The supervillains of DESTRON have conquered the country, The Big Axe has been imprisoned, and the heroes of the Corporation for UltraHuman Protection have been reduced to hiding behind a force field surrounding New York City.</p>

<p>And if that’s not enough, Andrea Vernon is pregnant. With a Little Axe.</p>

<p>But Andrea’s not one to sit on the sidelines. She has to make a plan to save the country, rescue her boyfriend, and figure out what exactly people do with babies. And a whole new slate of enemies is coming for CUP, led by the newly installed dictator of America, Dr. Robotfury, and his ingenious mecha-administrative assistant who bears a rather frightening resemblance to Andrea.</p>

<p>It’s a lot to wrap up before you go on maternity leave.”</p>
