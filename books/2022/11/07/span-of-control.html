<p><strong>Span Of Control - What To Do When You’re Under Pressure, Overwhelmed, And Ready To Get What You Really Want</strong> by Carey D. Lohrenz</p>

<p><sup>isbn-13: 9781950863662</sup></p>

<p><em>Audible</em></p>

<p><strong>Publisher’s Description:</strong>
“What can you control? What do you do when you’re under pressure,
overwhelmed, and ready to get what you really want? As one of the first
female F-14 Tomcat fighter pilots in the US Navy, as well as a mom, wife,
business consultant, Wall Street Journal bestselling author, and global
speaker, author Carey Lohrenz knows that the stress we experience can be
just as intense as the stress in the cockpit of a fighter jet going Mach 2.
But she’s got a secret weapon to prevail: years of training to overcome the
specific natures of uncertainty, stress, burnout, anxiety, and pressure. At
our core, we know we’ve lost control. We’ve lost our grip on what we really
want and who we really want to be. In order to solve the challenges of
chaos and make our goals, dreams, and commitments a reality, we have to
understand that in order to succeed when the pressure is on and to improve
our performance overall, we’ve got to know what we can and cannot control.
In Span of Control, Lohrenz walks us through the fundamentals of surviving
and succeeding during times of crisis. Weaving together eye-opening
science, gripping personal stories, insightful interviews, prescriptive
advice, and a high-octane dose of encouragement and practicality, Span of
Control helps leaders recognize how to focus on what matters most,
formulate a plan for success, and communicate what’s possible.”</p>
