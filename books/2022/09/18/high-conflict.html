<p><strong>High Conflict - Why We Get Trapped And How We Get Out</strong> by Amanda Ripley</p>

<p><sup>isbn-13: 9781982128562</sup></p>

<p><em>Audible</em></p>

<p>I read this as part of my ongoing desire to understand why our society is becoming increasingly polarized and what we can do to understand each other better. A number of good takeaways from this book - for me the primary one was to avoid binary classifications that inevitably become “them and us”.</p>

<p><strong>Publisher’s Description:</strong>
““In the tradition of bestselling explainers like The Tipping Point, [this]
book [is] based on cutting edge science that breaks down the idea of
extreme conflict–the kind that paralyzes people and places–and then shows
how to escape it”–”</p>
