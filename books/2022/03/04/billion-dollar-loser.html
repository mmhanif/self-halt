<p><strong>Billion Dollar Loser - The Epic Rise And Spectacular Fall Of Adam Neumann And Wework</strong> by Reeves Wiedeman</p>

<p><sup>isbn-13: 9780316461368</sup></p>

<p><em>Audible</em></p>

<p><strong>Publisher’s Description:</strong>
“This inside story of the rise and fall of WeWork reveals how the excesses
of its founder shaped a corporate culture unlike any other. Christened a
potential savior of Silicon Valley’s startup culture, Adam Neumann was set
to take WeWork, his office share company disrupting the commercial real
estate market, public, cash out on the company’s 47 billion dollar
valuation, and break the string of major startups unable to deliver to
shareholders. But as employees knew, and investors soon found out, WeWork’s
capital was built on promises that the company was more than a real estate
purveyor, that in fact it was a transformational technology company.
Veteran journalist Reeves Weideman dives deep into WeWork and it CEO’s
astronomical rise, from the marijuana and tequila-filled board rooms to
cult-like company summer camps and consciousness-raising with Anthony
Kiedis. Billion Dollar Loser is a character-driven business narrative that
captures, through the fascinating psyche of a billionaire founder and his
wife and co-founder, the slippery state of global capitalism.”</p>
