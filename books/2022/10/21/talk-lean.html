<p><strong>Talk Lean - Shorter Meetings. Quicker Results. Better Relations</strong> by Alan Palmer</p>

<p><sup>isbn-13: 9780857084972</sup></p>

<p><em>Paperback</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“From a communications perspective, the most important similarity among disparate individuals is the universal wish of human beings to be spoken to in a way which marries directness, concision and clarity with respect, politeness and courtesy.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lot of useful tips in this book about how to use more precise language to get better results. Some of the examples feel very British but I think the advice is universal.</p>
