<p><strong>The 6 Types Of Working Genius - A Better Way To Understand Your Gifts, Your Frustrations, And Your Team</strong> by Patrick M. Lencioni</p>

<p><sup>isbn-13: 9781637743294</sup></p>

<p><em>Hardcover</em></p>

<p>I’m a fan of Lencioni’s books and this one provides useful insights into the sorts of things that might provide different people either joy or frustration at work. I used the model from the book with my team at Meta for our second team “summit” (aka offsite in the world of Finance) and found it very helpful.</p>

<p><strong>Publisher’s Description:</strong>
“New York Times best-selling author Patrick Lencioni unveils a truly
groundbreaking new model that will change the way we think about work and
teams forever. The 6 Types of Working Genius is the fastest way to help
people identify the type of work that brings them joy and energy, and avoid
work that leads to frustration and burnout. Beyond the personal discovery
and instant relief that Working Genius provides, the model also gives teams
a remarkably simple and practical framework for tapping into one another’s
natural gifts, which increases productivity and reduces unnecessary
judgment. In classic Lencioni fashion, Pat brings his model to life in a
page-turning fable that is as relatable as it is compelling. He tells the
story of Bull Brooks, an entrepreneur, husband, and father who sets out to
solve his own frustration at work and stumbles into a new way of thinking
that changes the way he sees his work, his team, and even his marriage.
What sets this book—and the model behind it—apart from other tools and
assessments is the speed at which it can be understood and applied, and the
relevance it has to every kind of work in life, from running a company to
launching a product to managing a family. In addition to this book,
Lencioni and the Table Group have created a 10-minute assessment that helps
individuals quickly identify their gifts and apply this model to themselves
and their teams. Join the hundreds of thousands of people who have already
discovered their Working Genius, and experience the transformation in your
work, your team, and your life. Learn more about the Working Genius at
WorkingGenius.com.”</p>
