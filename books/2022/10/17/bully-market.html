<p><strong>Bully Market - My Story Of Money And Misogyny At Goldman Sachs</strong> by Jamie Fiore Higgins</p>

<p><strong>Publisher’s Description:</strong>
“A rare, riveting insider’s account on Wall Street—an updated Liar’s
Poker—where greed coupled with misogyny and discrimination enforces a
culture of exclusion in the upper echelons of Goldman Sachs Jamie Fiore
Higgins became one of the few women at the highest ranks of Goldman Sachs.
Spurred on by the obligation she felt to her working-class immigrant
family, she rose through the ranks and saw it all: out-of-control, lavish
parties flowing with never-ending drinks; affairs flouted in the office;
rampant drug use; and most pervasively, a discriminatory culture that
seemed designed to hold back the few women and people of color employed at
the company. Despite Goldman Sachs having the right talking points and
statistics, Fiore Higgins soon realized that these provided a veneer to
cover up what she found to be an abusive culture. Her account is one filled
with shocking stories of harassment and jaw-dropping tales of exclusionary
behavior: when she was told she only got promoted because she is a woman;
when her coworkers mooed at her after she pumped for her fourth child,
defying the superior who had advised her not to breastfeed; or when a male
boss used a racial epithet in front of her, other colleagues, and clients
without any repercussions. Bully Market sounds the alarm on the culture of
finance and corporate America, while offering clear, actionable ideas for
creating a fairer workplace. Both a revealing, extraordinary look at the
industry and a top Wall Streeter’s explosive personal story, Bully Market
is an essential account of one woman’s experience in a flawed system that
speaks to the challenge and urgency for change.”</p>
