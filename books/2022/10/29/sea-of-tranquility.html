<p><strong>Publisher’s Description:</strong>
“NEW YORK TIMES BEST SELLER • The award-winning, best-selling author of
Station Eleven and The Glass Hotel returns with a novel of art, time
travel, love, and plague that takes the reader from Vancouver Island in
1912 to a dark colony on the moon five hundred years later, unfurling a
story of humanity across centuries and space. “One of [Mandel’s] finest
novels and one of her most satisfying forays into the arena of speculative
fiction yet.” —The New York Times Edwin St. Andrew is eighteen years old
when he crosses the Atlantic by steamship, exiled from polite society
following an ill-conceived diatribe at a dinner party. He enters the
forest, spellbound by the beauty of the Canadian wilderness, and suddenly
hears the notes of a violin echoing in an airship terminal—an experience
that shocks him to his core. Two centuries later a famous writer named
Olive Llewellyn is on a book tour. She’s traveling all over Earth, but her
home is the second moon colony, a place of white stone, spired towers, and
artificial beauty. Within the text of Olive’s best-selling pandemic novel
lies a strange passage: a man plays his violin for change in the echoing
corridor of an airship terminal as the trees of a forest rise around him.
When Gaspery-Jacques Roberts, a detective in the black-skied Night City, is
hired to investigate an anomaly in the North American wilderness, he
uncovers a series of lives upended: The exiled son of an earl driven to
madness, a writer trapped far from home as a pandemic ravages Earth, and a
childhood friend from the Night City who, like Gaspery himself, has
glimpsed the chance to do something extraordinary that will disrupt the
timeline of the universe. A virtuoso performance that is as human and
tender as it is intellectually playful, Sea of Tranquility is a novel of
time travel and metaphysics that precisely captures the reality of our
current moment.”</p>
