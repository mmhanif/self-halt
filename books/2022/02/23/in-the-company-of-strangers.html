<p><strong>In the Company of Strangers</strong> by Awais Khan</p>

<p><sup>isbn-13: 9781912881482</sup></p>

<p><em>Audible</em></p>

<p><strong>Publisher’s Description:</strong>
“Mona has almost everything: money, friends, social status…everything except for freedom. Languishing in her golden cage, she craves a sense of belonging. Desperate for emotional release, she turns to a friend who introduces her to a world of glitter, glamour, covert affairs and drugs.</p>

<p>There she meets Ali, a physically and emotionally wounded man, years younger than her. Heady with love, she begins a delicate game of deceit that spirals out of control and threatens to shatter the deceptive facade of conservatism erected by Lahori society, and potentially destroy everything that Mona has ever held dear.”</p>
