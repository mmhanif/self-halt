<p><strong>Publisher’s Description:</strong>
“Wall Street Journal bestseller “A welcome revelation.” –The Financial
Times Award-winning Wharton Professor and Choiceology podcast host Katy
Milkman has devoted her career to the study of behavior change. In this
ground-breaking book, Milkman reveals a proven path that can take you from
where you are to where you want to be, with a foreword from psychologist
Angela Duckworth, the best-selling author of Grit. Change comes most
readily when you understand what’s standing between you and success and
tailor your solution to that roadblock. If you want to work out more but
find exercise difficult and boring, downloading a goal-setting app probably
won’t help. But what if, instead, you transformed your workouts so they
became a source of pleasure instead of a chore? Turning an uphill battle
into a downhill one is the key to success. Drawing on Milkman’s original
research and the work of her world-renowned scientific collaborators, How
to Change shares strategic methods for identifying and overcoming common
barriers to change, such as impulsivity, procrastination, and
forgetfulness. Through case studies and engaging stories, you’ll learn: •
Why timing can be everything when it comes to making a change • How to turn
temptation and inertia into assets • That giving advice, even if it’s about
something you’re struggling with, can help you achieve more Whether you’re
a manager, coach, or teacher aiming to help others change for the better or
are struggling to kick-start change yourself, How to Change offers an
invaluable, science-based blueprint for achieving your goals, once and for
all.”</p>
