<p><strong>Born A Crime - Stories From A South African Childhood</strong> by Trevor Noah</p>

<p><sup>isbn-13: 9780399588198</sup></p>

<p><em>Audible</em></p>

<p>This had gotten rave reviews when it first came out, and they were well-deserved. Trevor Noah is a huge success today, but he’s had a remarkable and difficult early life. Along with being his personal story, this is also a story of South Africa during and after the overturning of Apartheid. Noah lets the reader see what it was like growing up poor and black in South Africa but always showing the humanity of the people he came into contact with.</p>

<p><strong>Publisher’s Description:</strong>
“#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • More than one million copies sold! A
“brilliant” (Lupita Nyong’o, Time), “poignant” (Entertainment Weekly),
“soul-nourishing” (USA Today) memoir about coming of age during the
twilight of apartheid “Noah’s childhood stories are told with all the
hilarity and intellect that characterizes his comedy, while illuminating a
dark and brutal period in South Africa’s history that must never be
forgotten.”—Esquire Winner of the Thurber Prize for American Humor and an
NAACP Image Award • Named one of the best books of the year by The New York
Time, USA Today, San Francisco Chronicle, NPR, Esquire, Newsday, and
Booklist Trevor Noah’s unlikely path from apartheid South Africa to the
desk of The Daily Show began with a criminal act: his birth. Trevor was
born to a white Swiss father and a black Xhosa mother at a time when such a
union was punishable by five years in prison. Living proof of his parents’
indiscretion, Trevor was kept mostly indoors for the earliest years of his
life, bound by the extreme and often absurd measures his mother took to
hide him from a government that could, at any moment, steal him away.
Finally liberated by the end of South Africa’s tyrannical white rule,
Trevor and his mother set forth on a grand adventure, living openly and
freely and embracing the opportunities won by a centuries-long struggle.
Born a Crime is the story of a mischievous young boy who grows into a
restless young man as he struggles to find himself in a world where he was
never supposed to exist. It is also the story of that young man’s
relationship with his fearless, rebellious, and fervently religious
mother—his teammate, a woman determined to save her son from the cycle of
poverty, violence, and abuse that would ultimately threaten her own life.
The stories collected here are by turns hilarious, dramatic, and deeply
affecting. Whether subsisting on caterpillars for dinner during hard times,
being thrown from a moving car during an attempted kidnapping, or just
trying to survive the life-and-death pitfalls of dating in high school,
Trevor illuminates his curious world with an incisive wit and unflinching
honesty. His stories weave together to form a moving and searingly funny
portrait of a boy making his way through a damaged world in a dangerous
time, armed only with a keen sense of humor and a mother’s unconventional,
unconditional love.”</p>
