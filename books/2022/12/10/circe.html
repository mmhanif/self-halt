<p><strong>Publisher’s Description:</strong>
“#1 New York Times Bestseller “ A bold and subversive retelling of the
goddess’s story, Circe manages to be both epic and intimate in its scope,
recasting the most infamous female figure from the Odyssey as a hero in her
own right.” — Alexandra Alter, New York Times In the house of Helios, god
of the sun and mightiest of the Titans, a daughter is born. But Circe is a
strange child–not powerful, like her father, nor viciously alluring like
her mother. Turning to the world of mortals for companionship, she
discovers that she does possess power–the power of witchcraft, which can
transform rivals into monsters and menace the gods themselves. Threatened,
Zeus banishes her to a deserted island, where she hones her occult craft,
tames wild beasts and crosses paths with many of the most famous figures in
all of mythology, including the Minotaur, Daedalus and his doomed son
Icarus, the murderous Medea, and, of course, wily Odysseus. But there is
danger, too, for a woman who stands alone, and Circe unwittingly draws the
wrath of both men and gods, ultimately finding herself pitted against one
of the most terrifying and vengeful of the Olympians. To protect what she
loves most, Circe must summon all her strength and choose, once and for
all, whether she belongs with the gods she is born from, or the mortals she
has come to love. With unforgettably vivid characters, mesmerizing language
and page-turning suspense, Circe is a triumph of storytelling, an
intoxicating epic of family rivalry, palace intrigue, love and loss, as
well as a celebration of indomitable female strength in a man’s world.”</p>
