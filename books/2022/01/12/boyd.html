<p><strong>Boyd - The Fighter Pilot Who Changed The Art Of War</strong> by Robert Coram</p>

<p><sup>isbn-13: 9780316796880</sup></p>

<p><em>Audible</em></p>

<p>John Boyd is probably up there in list of most influential Americans of the 20th Century
that very few people have heard of. A great fighter pilot who then went on to design
the F-15 and F-16 fighter aircraft and ended his career as a military theorist whose ideas
the US successfully used in both Gulf Wars. Boyd was an iconoclast who continually found
himself fighting the Air Force hierarchy. As well as in-depth biography of Boyd, the book
also provides an eye-opening inside view of Military-Industrial complex that Eisenhower warned
of. Boyd was deeply flawed in many ways but had a personal code of honor that guided him
throughout his career. My favorite quote of Boyd’s from the book is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“If your boss demands loyalty, give him integrity. But if he demands integrity, then give him loyalty”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are a small number of Audible books that I like so much that I buy a physical
copy of the book. This is one of those books.</p>

<p>Another great quote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“To be somebody or to do something. In life there is often a roll call. That’s when you will have to make a decision. To be or to do? Which way will you go?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Publisher’s Description:</strong>
“John Boyd may be the most remarkable unsung hero in all of American
military history. Some remember him as the greatest U.S. fighter pilot ever
– the man who, in simulated air-to-air combat, defeated every challenger
in less than forty seconds. Some recall him as the father of our country’s
most legendary fighter aircraft – the F-15 and F-16. Still others think of
Boyd as the most influential military theorist since Sun Tzu. They know
only half the story. Boyd, more than any other person, saved fighter
aviation from the predations of the Strategic Air Command. His manual of
fighter tactics changed the way every air force in the world flies and
fights. He discovered a physical theory that forever altered the way
fighter planes were designed. Later in life, he developed a theory of
military strategy that has been adopted throughout the world and even
applied to business models for maximizing efficiency. And in one of the
most startling and unknown stories of modern military history, the Air
Force fighter pilot taught the U.S. Marine Corps how to fight war on the
ground. His ideas led to America’s swift and decisive victory in the Gulf
War and foretold the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. On a personal
level, Boyd rarely met a general he couldn’t offend. He was loud, abrasive,
and profane. A man of daring, ferocious passion and intractable
stubbornness, he was that most American of heroes – a rebel who cared not
for his reputation or fortune but for his country. He was a true patriot, a
man who made a career of challenging the shortsighted and self-serving
Pentagon bureaucracy. America owes Boyd and his disciples – the six men
known as the “Acolytes” – a great debt. Robert Coram finally brings to
light the remarkable story of a man who polarized all who knew him, but who
left a legacy that will influence the military – and all of America – for
decades to come. ..”</p>
