<p><strong>Upstream - The Quest To Solve Problems Before They Happen</strong> by Dan Heath</p>

<p><sup>isbn-13: 9781982134723</sup></p>

<p><em>Audible</em></p>

<p><strong>Publisher’s Description:</strong>
“New York Times bestselling author Dan Heath explores how to prevent
problems before they happen, drawing on insights from hundreds of
interviews with unconventional problem solvers. So often in life, we get
stuck in a cycle of response. We put out fires. We deal with emergencies.
We stay downstream, handling one problem after another, but we never make
our way upstream to fix the systems that caused the problems. Cops chase
robbers, doctors treat patients with chronic illnesses, and call-center
reps address customer complaints. But many crimes, chronic illnesses, and
customer complaints are preventable. So why do our efforts skew so heavily
toward reaction rather than prevention? Upstream probes the psychological
forces that push us downstream—including “problem blindness,” which can
leave us oblivious to serious problems in our midst. And Heath introduces
us to the thinkers who have overcome these obstacles and scored massive
victories by switching to an upstream mindset. One online travel website
prevented twenty million customer service calls every year by making some
simple tweaks to its booking system. A major urban school district cut its
dropout rate in half after it figured out that it could predict which
students would drop out—as early as the ninth grade. A European nation
almost eliminated teenage alcohol and drug abuse by deliberately changing
the nation’s culture. And one EMS system accelerated the emergency-response
time of its ambulances by using data to predict where 911 calls would
emerge—and forward-deploying its ambulances to stand by in those areas.
Upstream delivers practical solutions for preventing problems rather than
reacting to them. How many problems in our lives and in society are we
tolerating simply because we’ve forgotten that we can fix them?”</p>
