<p><strong>Be The Hero - Three Powerful Ways To Overcome Challenges In Work And Life</strong> by Noah Blumenthal</p>

<p><sup>isbn-13: 9781609940829</sup></p>

<p><em>Audible</em></p>

<p>Another short and easy read in the “business fable” genre.</p>

<p><strong>Publisher’s Description:</strong>
“In this engaging parable, author Noah Blumenthal shows that we are all
master storytellers. Our stories are vivid, detailed, and convincing. These
aren’t the stories we tell around the watercooler or the campfire. They are
the stories we tell ourselves—the ones that rattle around in our heads and
move us to emotions and actions. If we don’t pay attention, these stories
can take us down the victim path—blaming, frustrated, helpless, and
hopeless. But at any moment, we have the power to identify and change these
stories. We can choose the right stories—the ones that enable us to become
“Everyday Heroes.” Be the Hero brings to life the entertaining tale of a
struggling young professional who moves from victim to hero by learning to
become aware of and change the stories that are holding him back. Battling
negativity, inertia, and anger, he learns to see life through a new lens,
to create new hero stories that develop his capacity to chart his own
course. The powerful resources at the end of the book, including a hero tip
of the week, smart cards, manager tip sheets, and more, will help you make
your hero stories stick. This simple parable will change your life forever.”</p>
