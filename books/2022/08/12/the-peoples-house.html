<p><strong>Publisher’s Description:</strong>
“Can someone heist the majority of the House of Representatives with no one
noticing? That’s the electoral coup that turns America upside down in THE
PEOPLE’S HOUSE… …Until one man notices. Political reporter Jack Sharpe
is logging time at the tail end of a disappointing career – jaded about
politics and stung by personal hard knocks. But after an odd election
result in the Ohio Congressional district he covers, Sharpe stumbles across
irregularities that spur him to dig deeper. The story takes him far beyond
his corner of Ohio as he discovers an international plot–one that strikes
at the heart of American democracy by taking advantage of weaknesses in
today’s political architecture. His reporting leads to a showdown with the
philandering Congressman and Presidential contender who knew about the plan
but told nobody, and the eccentric but deadly Russian energy baron who
masterminded it all. In order to save himself and the country, Sharpe must
rekindle his old fire to navigate a treacherous journey through danger,
betrayal, and atonement. About the Author David Pepper serves as Chairman
of the Ohio Democratic Party, and has been active in Ohio politics for 15
years. He was elected to the Cincinnati City Council and Hamilton County
Board of Commissioners, and ran statewide campaigns for Ohio Attorney
General and Auditor of State. David graduated from Yale and Yale Law
School. As an attorney, David has practiced law at several large law firms
and taught elections law and voting rights. Prior to law school, David
worked at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, living in
Washington D.C. while spending much of his time in St. Petersburg, Russia.
David is married to Alana Pepper, who are the proud parents of Jack, 2.”</p>
