<p><strong>Publisher’s Description:</strong>
“NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • “If Michael Crichton had written a superhero
novel, it would look a lot like Upgrade.”—The New York Times Book Review
“You don’t so much sympathize with the main character as live inside his
skin.”—DIANA GABALDON, #1 New York Times bestselling author of the
Outlander series “Mysterious, fascinating, and deeply moving—exploring the
very nature of what it means to be human.”—ALEX MICHAELIDES, #1 New York
Times bestselling author of The Silent Patient and The Maiden The mind-
blowing new thriller from the New York Times bestselling author of Dark
Matter and Recursion—currently in development as a motion picture at Steven
Spielberg’s Amblin Partners “You are the next step in human evolution.” At
first, Logan Ramsay isn’t sure if anything’s different. He just feels a
little . . . sharper. Better able to concentrate. Better at multitasking.
Reading a bit faster, memorizing better, needing less sleep. But before
long, he can’t deny it: Something’s happening to his brain. To his body.
He’s starting to see the world, and those around him—even those he loves
most—in whole new ways. The truth is, Logan’s genome has been hacked. And
there’s a reason he’s been targeted for this upgrade. A reason that goes
back decades to the darkest part of his past, and a horrific family legacy.
Worse still, what’s happening to him is just the first step in a much
larger plan, one that will inflict the same changes on humanity at large—at
a terrifying cost. Because of his new abilities, Logan’s the one person in
the world capable of stopping what’s been set in motion. But to have a
chance at winning this war, he’ll have to become something other than
himself. Maybe even something other than human. And even as he’s fighting,
he can’t help wondering: what if humanity’s only hope for a future really
does lie in engineering our own evolution? Intimate in scale yet epic in
scope, Upgrade is an intricately plotted, lightning-fast tale that charts
one man’s thrilling transformation, even as it asks us to ponder the limits
of our humanity—and our boundless potential.”</p>
