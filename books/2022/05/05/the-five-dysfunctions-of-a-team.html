<p><sup>isbn-13: 9780787960759</sup></p>

<p>A classic that I assigned to my team at Meta for our first team “summit”. Easy, short read that is valuable for anyone working in a team (which is pretty much everyone).</p>

<p><strong>Publisher’s Description:</strong>
“The New York Times best-selling team leadership handbook for modern
executives, managers, and organizations After her first two weeks observing
the problems at DecisionTech, Kathryn Petersen, its new CEO, had more than
a few moments when she wondered if she should have taken the job. But
Kathryn knew there was little chance she would have turned it down. After
all, retirement had made her antsy, and nothing excited her more than a
challenge. What she could not have known when she accepted the job,
however, was just how dysfunctional her team was, and how team members
would challenge her in ways that no one ever had before. For twenty years,
The Five Dysfunctions of a Team has been engaging audiences with a page-
turning, realistic fable that follows the travails of Kathryn Petersen,
DecisionTech’s CEO, as she faces the ultimate leadership crisis. She must
unite a team in such disarray that it threatens to derail the entire
company. Equal parts leadership fable and business handbook, this
definitive source on teamwork by Patrick Lencioni reveals the five
behavioral tendencies that go to the heart of why even the best teams
struggle. He offers a powerful model and step-by-step guide for overcoming
those dysfunctions and getting every one rowing in the same direction.
Today, the lessons in The Five Dysfunctions of a Team are more relevant
than ever. This special anniversary edition celebrates one of the best-
selling business books of all time with a new foreword from the author that
reflects on its legacy and lessons.”</p>
