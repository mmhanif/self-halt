*Publisher's Description*

NATIONAL BESTSELLER • The chilling bestselling alternate history novel of
what happens to one family when America elects a charismatic, isolationist
president whose government embraces anti-Semitism—from the Pulitzer
Prize–winning author of American Pastoral. “A terrific political novel....
Sinister, vivid, dreamlike...You turn the pages, astonished and
frightened.” —The New York Times Book Review One of the New York Times’s
100 Best Books of the 21st Century In an extraordinary feat of narrative
invention, Philip Roth imagines an alternate history where Franklin D.
Roosevelt loses the 1940 presidential election to heroic aviator and rabid
isolationist Charles A. Lindbergh. Shortly thereafter, Lindbergh negotiates
a cordial "understanding" with Adolf Hitler, while the new government
embarks on a program of folksy anti-Semitism.
