This book by Bridgewater Associates founder, Ray Dalio comes in three parts:
I. "Where I'm Coming From" where Ray gives an autobiographical account of his life to date. 
II. "Life Principles" gives the overarching principles that drive Dalio's approach to everything.
III. "Work Principles" details the principles that govern how Bridgewater Associates works as an *idea meritocracy* that tries to deliver meaningful work and relationships through *radical truth* and *radical transparency*.
It's refreshing to see someone lay out the blueprint of their thinking in such a systematic way. The principles that Dalio lays out are definitely thought-provoking. I will say that that for me, the first section ("Where I'm Coming From") was the most interesting and engaging part of the book. "Life Principles" provided much food for thought but "Work Principles" started getting a bit heavy going.
A summary of the principles is giving below:
*"Think for yourself to decide 1) what you want, 2) what is true, and 3) what you should do to achieve #1 in light of #2, and do that with humility and open-mindedness so that you consider the best thinking that is available to you."*
