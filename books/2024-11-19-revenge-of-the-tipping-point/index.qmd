*Publisher's Description*

Twenty-five years after the publication of his groundbreaking first book,
Malcolm Gladwell returns with a brand-new volume that reframes the lessons
of The Tipping Point in a startling and revealing light. Why is
Miami...Miami? What does the heartbreaking fate of the cheetah tell us
about the way we raise our children? Why do Ivy League schools care so much
about sports? What is the Magic Third, and what does it mean for racial
harmony? In this provocative new work, Malcolm Gladwell returns for the
first time in twenty-five years to the subject of social epidemics and
tipping points, this time with the aim of explaining the dark side of
contagious phenomena. Through a series of riveting stories, Gladwell traces
the rise of a new and troubling form of social engineering. He takes us to
the streets of Los Angeles to meet the world's most successful bank
robbers, rediscovers a forgotten television show from the 1970s that
changed the world, visits the site of a historic experiment on a tiny cul-
de-sac in northern California, and offers an alternate history of two of
the biggest epidemics of our day: COVID and the opioid crisis. Revenge of
the Tipping Point is Gladwell's most personal book yet. With his
characteristic mix of storytelling and social science, he offers a guide to
making sense of the contagions of modern world. It's time we took tipping
points seriously.
