*Publisher's Description*

With a new preface by the author, this reissue of Thomas Sowell's classic
study of decision making updates his seminal work in the context of The
Vision of the Annointed, Sowell, one of America's most celebrated public
intellectuals, describes in concrete detail how knowledge is shared and
disseminated throughout modern society. He warns that society suffers from
an ever-widening gap between firsthand knowledge and decision making—a gap
that threatens not only our economic and political efficiency, but our very
freedom because actual knowledge gets replaced by assumptions based on an
abstract and elitist social vision f what ought to be.Knowledge and
Decisions, a winner of the 1980 Law and Economics Center Prize, was
heralded as a ”landmark work” and selected for this prize ”because of its
cogent contribution to our understanding of the differences between the
market process and the process of government.” In announcing the award, the
center acclaimed Sowell, whose ”contribution to our understanding of the
process of regulation alone would make the book important, but in
reemphasizing the diversity and efficiency that the market makes possible,
[his] work goes deeper and becomes even more significant.”
