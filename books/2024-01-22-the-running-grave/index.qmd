*Audible*

Latest in series of Cormoran Strike and Robin Ellacott crime novels and one of my favorites to date. Strike and Ellacott investigate a secretive cult and Robin goes undercover to join the cult and uncover their secrets. This installment finally brings some closure to Strike's relationship with Charlotte and (finally) admitting his true feelings for Robin.  

*Publisher's Description*

The brand new installment in the highly acclaimed international bestselling
series, featuring Cormoran Strike and Robin Ellacott, written by Robert
Galbraith, a pseudonym of J.K. Rowling.Praise for the Strike series "There
can be no denying J.K. Rowling's formidable talents as a crime writer."
­--Daily Mail "The work of a master storyteller."--Daily Telegraph
"Delivered with panache." --Financial Times "A scrupulous plotter and
master of misdirection, Galbraith keeps the pages turning." --TheGuardian
"A blistering piece of crime writing." --Sunday Times "Stuffed with
intrigue, surprise, action, violence, social comedy and romance: 'value for
money, ' as the British say" --Wall Street Journal "Rowling's greatest
novelistic gifts are her ability to spin wild, intricate plots, and to
create colorful, highly individual characters who come instantly alive on
the page." --Washington Post "Rowling's wizardry as a writer is on abundant
display...This is a crime series deeply rooted in the real world, where
brutality and ugliness are leavened by the oh-so-human flaws and virtues of
Galbraith's irresistible hero and heroine." --USA Today "Compulsively
readable." ―People "Addictive, murderous fun." ―Vox
