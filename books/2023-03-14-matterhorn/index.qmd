*Publisher's Description*

An incredible publishing story--written over the course of thirty years by
a highly decorated Vietnam veteran, a New York Times best seller for
sixteen weeks, a National Indie Next and a USA Today best seller--
Matterhorn has been hailed as a "brilliant account of war" (New York Times
Book Review). Now out in paperback, Matterhorn is an epic war novel in the
tradition of Norman Mailer's The Naked and the Dead and James Jones's The
Thin Red Line. It is the timeless story of a young Marine lieutenant, Waino
Mellas, and his comrades in Bravo Company, who are dropped into the
mountain jungle of Vietnam as boys and forced to fight their way into
manhood. Standing in their way are not merely the North Vietnamese but also
monsoon rain and mud, leeches and tigers, disease and malnutrition. Almost
as daunting, it turns out, are the obstacles they discover between each
other: racial tension, competing ambitions, and duplicitous superior
officers. But when the company finds itself surrounded and outnumbered by a
massive enemy regiment, the Marines are thrust into the raw and all-
consuming terror of combat. The experience will change them forever.
Matterhorn is a visceral and spellbinding novel about what it is like to be
a young man at war. It is an unforgettable novel that transforms the
tragedy of Vietnam into a powerful and universal story of courage,
camaraderie, and sacrifice: a parable not only of the war in Vietnam but of
all war, and a testament to the redemptive power of literature.
