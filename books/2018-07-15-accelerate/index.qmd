I was definitely looking forward to reading this as one of the authors, Gene Kim, also co-authored one of my favorite books related to software development, "The Phoenix Project". This book is a little drier than the Phoenix Project ... actually a lot drier. It's an assesment of what software development practices are the biggest indicators of success based on rigorous research.

## Model

Their research uncovered 24 key capabilities that drive software delivery performance, classified into five categories:

3. Continuous Integration
4. Trunk-based Development
5. Test Automation
6. Test Data Management
7. Shift-left on Security
8. Continuous Deployment

### ARCHITECTURE CAPABILITIES
9. Loosely-coupled Architecture
10. Empowered Teams

### PRODUCT AND PROCESS CAPABILITIES
11. Customer Feedback
12. Value Stream
13. Working in Small Batches
14. Team Experimentation

### LEAN MANAGEMENT AND MONITORING CAPABILITIES
15. Lightweight Change Approval Processes
16. Monitoring
