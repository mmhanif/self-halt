*Publisher's Description*

1986, the heart of the Cold War. A young black woman working in an old
boys' club, Marie Mitchell's FBI career has stalled out and her days are
filled with monotonous paperwork. Given the opportunity to join a task
force aimed at undermining Thomas Sankara, the charismatic revolutionary
president of Burkina Faso whose Communist ideology has made him a target
for American intervention, she says yes. In the year that follows Marie
observes Sankara, seduces him-- and has a hand in the coup that will bring
him down. But doing so will change everything she believes about what it
means to be a spy, a lover, a sister, and a good American. -- adapted from
jacket.
