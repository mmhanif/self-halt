*Publisher's Description*

A young Pakistani woman is the victim of an unthinkable act of vengeance,
when she defies tradition ... facing seemingly insurmountable challenges
and danger when she attempts to rebuild her life. Multan, Pakistan. A
conservative city where an unmarried woman over the age of twenty-five is
considered a curse by her family. Ayesha is twenty-seven. Independent and
happily single, she has evaded an arranged marriage because of her family's
reduced circumstances. When she catches the eye of powerful, wealthy Raza,
it seems like the answer to her parents' prayers. But Ayesha is in love
with someone else, and when she refuses to give up on him, Raza resorts to
unthinkable revenge... Ayesha travels to London to rebuild her life and
there she meets Kamil, an emotionally damaged man who has demons of his
own. They embark on a friendship that could mean salvation for both of
them, but danger stalks Ayesha in London, too. With her life thrown into
turmoil, she is forced to make a decision that could change her and
everyone she loves forever. Exquisitely written, populated by unforgettable
characters and rich with poignant, powerful themes, Someone Like Her is a
story of love and family, of corruption and calamity, of courage and hope
... and one woman's determination to thwart convention and find peace, at
whatever cost...
