*Publisher's Description*

NEW YORK TIMES BEST SELLER • In this exhilarating novel by the best-selling
author of The Storied Life of A. J. Fikry two friends—often in love, but
never lovers—come together as creative partners in the world of video game
design, where success brings them fame, joy, tragedy, duplicity, and,
ultimately, a kind of immortality. "Utterly brilliant. In this sweeping,
gorgeously written novel, Gabrielle Zevin charts the beauty, tenacity, and
fragility of human love and creativity.... One of the best books I've ever
read." —John Green On a bitter-cold day, in the December of his junior year
at Harvard, Sam Masur exits a subway car and sees, amid the hordes of
people waiting on the platform, Sadie Green. He calls her name. For a
moment, she pretends she hasn’t heard him, but then, she turns, and a game
begins: a legendary collaboration that will launch them to stardom. These
friends, intimates since childhood, borrow money, beg favors, and, before
even graduating college, they have created their first blockbuster, Ichigo.
Overnight, the world is theirs. Not even twenty-five years old, Sam and
Sadie are brilliant, successful, and rich, but these qualities won’t
protect them from their own creative ambitions or the betrayals of their
hearts. Spanning thirty years, from Cambridge, Massachusetts, to Venice
Beach, California, and lands in between and far beyond, Gabrielle Zevin’s
Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow is a dazzling and intricately imagined
novel that examines the multifarious nature of identity, disability,
failure, the redemptive possibilities in play, and above all, our need to
connect: to be loved and to love. Yes, it is a love story, but it is not
one you have read before.
