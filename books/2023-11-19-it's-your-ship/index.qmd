*Publisher's Description*

Read this million-copy bestseller for leadership insights about top-down
change to improve productivity in your business starting with the most
important person: You. When Captain Abrashoff took over as commander of USS
Benfold, it was like a business that had all the latest technology but only
some of the productivity. Knowing that responsibility for improving
performance rested with him, he realized he had to improve his own
leadership skills before he could improve his ship. Within months, he
created a crew of confident and inspired problem-solvers eager to take the
initiative and responsibility for their actions. The slogan on board became
"It's your ship," and Benfold was soon recognized far and wide as a model
of naval efficiency. How did Abrashoff do it? Against the backdrop of
today's United States Navy, Abrashoff shares his secrets of successful
management including: See the ship through the eyes of the crew: By
soliciting a sailor's suggestions, Abrashoff drastically reduced tedious
chores that provided little additional value. Communicate, communicate,
communicate: The more Abrashoff communicated the plan, the better the
crew's performance. His crew eventually started calling him "Megaphone
Mike," since they heard from him so often. Create discipline by focusing on
purpose: Discipline skyrocketed when Abrashoff's crew believed that what
they were doing was important. Listen aggressively: After learning that
many sailors wanted to use the GI Bill, Abrashoff brought a test official
aboard the ship-and held the SATs forty miles off the Iraqi coast. From
achieving amazing cost savings to winning the highest gunnery score in the
Pacific Fleet, Captain Abrashoff's extraordinary campaign sent shock waves
through the U.S. Navy. It can help you change the course of your ship, no
matter where your business battles are fought.
