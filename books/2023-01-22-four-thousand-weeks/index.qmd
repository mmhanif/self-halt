AN INSTANT NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER Provocative and appealing . . . well
worth your extremely limited time. --Barbara Spindel, The Wall Street
Journal The average human lifespan is absurdly, insultingly brief. Assuming
you live to be eighty, you have just over four thousand weeks. Nobody needs
telling there isn't enough time. We're obsessed with our lengthening to-do
lists, our overfilled inboxes, work-life balance, and the ceaseless battle
against distraction; and we're deluged with advice on becoming more
productive and efficient, and "life hacks" to optimize our days. But such
techniques often end up making things worse. The sense of anxious hurry
grows more intense, and still the most meaningful parts of life seem to lie
just beyond the horizon. Still, we rarely make the connection between our
daily struggles with time and the ultimate time management problem: the
challenge of how best to use our four thousand weeks. Drawing on the
insights of both ancient and contemporary philosophers, psychologists, and
spiritual teachers, Oliver Burkeman delivers an entertaining, humorous,
practical, and ultimately profound guide to time and time management.
Rejecting the futile modern fixation on "getting everything done," Four
Thousand Weeks introduces readers to tools for constructing a meaningful
life by embracing finitude, showing how many of the unhelpful ways we've
come to think about time aren't inescapable, unchanging truths, but choices
we've made as individuals and as a society--and that we could do things
differently.
