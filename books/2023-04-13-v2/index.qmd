*Publisher's Description*

NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER From the bestselling author of Fatherland and
Munich comes a WWII thriller about a German rocket engineer, a former
actress turned British spy, and the Nazi rocket program. The first rocket
will take five minutes to hit London. You have six minutes to stop the
second. Rudi Graf is an engineer who always dreamed of sending rockets to
the moon. But instead, he finds himself working alongside Wernher von
Braun, launching V2 rockets at London for the Nazis from a bleak seaside
town in occupied Holland. As the SS increases its scrutiny on the project,
Graf, an engineer more than a soldier, has to muster all of his willpower
to toe the party line. And when rumors of a defector circulate through the
German ranks, Graf becomes a prime suspect. Meanwhile, Kay Caton-Walsh, a
young English intelligence officer, is living through the turmoil of war.
After she and her lover, an RAF officer, are caught in a V2 attack, she
volunteers to ship out for newly liberated Belgium. Armed with little more
than a slide rule and a few equations, Kay and her colleagues hope to
locate and destroy the launch sites. But at this stage in the war it’s hard
to know who, if anyone, she can trust. As the death toll soars, these twin
stories play out against the background of the German missile campaign
during the Second World War. And what the reader comes to understand is
that Kay’s and Graf’s destinies are on a collision course.
