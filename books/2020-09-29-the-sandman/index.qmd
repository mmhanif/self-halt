*Audible*

A full-cast audiobook adaptation of Neil Gaiman's Sandman comicbooks. The first half of the book is a single story line following the imprisonment of Morpheus (the Lord of Dreams) and his subsequent question to restore his power. The remaining chapters are a series of mostly unconnected vignettes that I found to be a bit hit or miss.
