**Publisher's Description:**
"My name is Peter Grant and until January I was just probationary constable
in that mighty army for justice known to all right-thinking people as the
Metropolitan Police Service (as the Filth to everybody else). My only
concerns in life were how to avoid a transfer to the Case Progression Unit
- we do paperwork so real coppers don't have to - and finding a way to
climb into the panties of the outrageously perky WPC Leslie May. Then one
night, in pursuance of a murder inquiry, I tried to take a witness
statement from someone who was dead but disturbingly voluable, and that
brought me to the attention of Inspector Nightingale, the last wizard in
England. Now I'm a Detective Constable and a trainee wizard, the first
apprentice in fifty years, and my world has become somewhat more
complicated: nests of vampires in Purley, negotiating a truce between the
warring god and goddess of the Thames, and digging up graves in Covent
Garden . . . and there's something festering at the heart of the city I
love, a malicious vengeful spirit that takes ordinary Londoners and twists
them into grotesque mannequins to act out its drama of violence and
despair. The spirit of riot and rebellion has awakened in the city, and
it's falling to me to bring order out of chaos - or die trying."
