*Audible*

A somewhat different character to this novel from Tana French - she leaves the environs of Dublin for the rural West of Ireland. The claustrophobic, urban feel of her previous novels is replaced with a more open, big-sky imagery. The story ends on a more hopeful note for the protagonist than her previous novels - they usually end with the protagonist having lost all in the process of uncovering the mystery.

**Publisher's Description:**

"A spellbinding, propulsive new novel from the bestselling mystery writer
who "is in a class by herself." (The New York Times) Cal Hooper thought a
fixer-upper in a bucolic Irish village would be the perfect escape. After
twenty-five years in the Chicago police force and a bruising divorce, he
just wants to build a new life in a pretty spot with a good pub where
nothing much happens. But when a local kid whose brother has gone missing
arm-twists him into investigating, Cal uncovers layers of darkness beneath
his picturesque retreat, and starts to realize that even small towns
shelter dangerous secrets. "One of the greatest crime novelists writing
today" (Vox) weaves a masterful, atmospheric tale of suspense, asking what
we sacrifice in our search for truth and justice, and what we risk if we
don't."
