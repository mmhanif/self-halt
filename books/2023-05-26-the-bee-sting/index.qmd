*Publisher's Description*

"The Barnes family is in trouble. Dickie's once-lucrative car business is
going under--but rather than face the music, he's spending his days in the
woods, building an apocalypse-proof bunker with a renegade handyman. His
wife Imelda is selling off her jewelry on eBay, while their teenage
daughter Cass, formerly top of her class, seems determined to binge-drink
her way through her final exams. And twelve-year-old PJ is putting the
final touches to his grand plan to run away from home. Where did it all go
wrong? A patch of ice on the tarmac, a casual favor to a charming stranger,
a bee caught beneath a bridal veil--can a single moment of bad luck change
the direction of a life? And if the story has already been written--is
there still time to find a happy ending?"--
