*Publisher's Description*

The “endlessly entertaining” (Matt Levine) and “ludicrously compelling”
(Evan Osnos) account of the crypto delusion, and how Sam Bankman-Fried and
a cast of fellow nerds and hustlers turned useless virtual coins into
trillions of dollars “One of the greatest business stories of all
time.”—A.J. Jacobs, bestselling author of The Puzzler In 2021
cryptocurrency went mainstream. Giant investment funds were buying it,
celebrities like Tom Brady endorsed it, and TV ads hailed it as the future
of money. Hardly anyone knew how it worked—but why bother with the
particulars when everyone was making a fortune from Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, or
some other bizarrely named “digital asset”? As he observed this frenzy,
investigative reporter Zeke Faux had a nagging question: Was it all just a
confidence game of epic proportions? What started as curiosity—with a dash
of FOMO—would morph into a two-year, globe-spanning quest to understand the
wizards behind the world’s new financial machinery. Faux’s investigation
would lead him to a schlubby, frizzy-haired twenty-nine-year-old named Sam
Bankman-Fried (SBF for short) and a host of other crypto scammers,
utopians, and overnight billionaires. Faux follows the trail to a luxury
resort in the Bahamas, where SBF boldly declares that he will use his
crypto fortune to save the world. Faux talks his way onto the yacht of a
former child actor turned crypto impresario and gains access to “ApeFest,”
an elite party headlined by Snoop Dogg, by purchasing a $20,000 image of a
cartoon monkey. In El Salvador, Faux learns what happens when a country
wagers its treasury on Bitcoin, and in the Philippines, he stumbles upon a
Pokémon knockoff mobile game touted by boosters as a cure for poverty. And
in an astonishing development, a spam text leads Faux to Cambodia, where he
uncovers a crypto-powered human-trafficking ring. When the bubble suddenly
bursts in 2022, Faux brings readers inside SBF’s penthouse as the fallen
crypto king faces his imminent arrest. Fueled by the absurd details and
authoritative reporting that earned Zeke Faux the accolade “our great poet
of crime” (Money Stuff columnist Matt Levine), Number Go Up is the
essential chronicle, by turns harrowing and uproarious, of a $3 trillion
financial delusion.
