*Publisher's Description*

In the war for business supremacy, the old management models and
stereotypes pitting suits against nerds must be thrown out. Instead,
business leaders looking to lead their company into the digital age must
learn to harness the expertise and innovation that is already under their
roof: IT. Thought leader and author Mark Schwartz provides clear context
and strategies for business leaders to create new strategies for business
leaders looking to unlock their enterprise's digital transformation.
