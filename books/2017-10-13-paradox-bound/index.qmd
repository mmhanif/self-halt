(*Audible Unabridged, narrated by Ray Porter*)

I've been a fan of Peter Clines ever since reading '14' a few years ago, and have read most of his output to date. Enjoyable steampunk-style science fiction, not overy intellectual, but with enough twists and turns to be interesting. This novel incorporates time-travel of sorts, a genre that I love. The overall premise is, I admit a little hokey, but if you can put that to one side there's a lot to enjoy in this novel.
