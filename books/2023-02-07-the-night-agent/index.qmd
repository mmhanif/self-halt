*Publisher's Description*

Soon to be a Netflix original series! "Plenty of breathless one-more-
chapter, stay-up-late suspense wrapped around a meaty and timely story...
irresistible." -- Lee Child To find a Russian mole in the White House, an
FBI agent must question everything. . . and trust no one. No one is more
surprised than FBI Agent Peter Sutherland when he's tapped to work in the
White House Situation Room. When Peter was a boy, his father was suspected
of selling secrets to the Russians--a breach that cost him his career, his
reputation, and eventually his life. Now Peter's job is monitoring an
emergency line for a call that has not--and might never--come. Until
tonight. At 1:05 A.M. the phone rings. A terrified young woman named Rose
tells Peter that two people have just been murdered and that the killer
might still be in the house with her. One of the victims gave her this
phone number with urgent instructions: "Tell them OSPREY was right. It's
happening..." The call thrusts Peter into the heart of a conspiracy years
in the making, involving a Russian mole at the highest levels of the U.S.
government. Anyone in the White House could be the traitor. Anyone could be
corrupted. To save the nation, Peter must take the rules into his own
hands, question everything, and trust no one.
