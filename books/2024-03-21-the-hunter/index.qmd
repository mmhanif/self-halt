Named a Best Beach Read of 2024 by Entertainment Tonight and Harper’s
Bazaar “Hailed as the queen of Irish crime fiction, French spins a taut
tale of retribution, sacrifice, and family.”—TIME From the New York Times
bestselling author of The Searcher and “one of the greatest crime novelists
writing today” (Vox), a spellbinding new novel set in the Irish
countryside. It’s a blazing summer when two men arrive in a small village
in the West of Ireland. One of them is coming home. Both of them are coming
to get rich. One of them is coming to die. Cal Hooper took early retirement
from Chicago PD and moved to rural Ireland looking for peace. He’s found
it, more or less: he’s built a relationship with a local woman, Lena, and
he’s gradually turning Trey Reddy from a half-feral teenager into a good
kid going good places. But then Trey’s long-absent father reappears,
bringing along an English millionaire and a scheme to find gold in the
townland, and suddenly everything the three of them have been building is
under threat. Cal and Lena are both ready to do whatever it takes to
protect Trey, but Trey doesn’t want protecting. What she wants is revenge.
From the writer who is “in a class by herself,” (The New York Times), a
nuanced, atmospheric tale that explores what we’ll do for our loved ones,
what we’ll do for revenge, and what we sacrifice when the two collide.
