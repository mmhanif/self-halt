*Publisher's Description*

Bono—artist, activist, and the lead singer of Irish rock band U2—has
written a memoir: honest and irreverent, intimate and profound, Surrender
is the story of the remarkable life he’s lived, the challenges he’s faced,
and the friends and family who have shaped and sustained him. “When I
started to write this book, I was hoping to draw in detail what I’d
previously only sketched in songs. The people, places, and possibilities in
my life. Surrender is a word freighted with meaning for me. Growing up in
Ireland in the seventies with my fists up (musically speaking), it was not
a natural concept. A word I only circled until I gathered my thoughts for
the book. I am still grappling with this most humbling of commands. In the
band, in my marriage, in my faith, in my life as an activist. Surrender is
the story of one pilgrim’s lack of progress ... With a fair amount of fun
along the way.” —Bono As one of the music world’s most iconic artists and
the cofounder of the organizations ONE and (RED), Bono’s career has been
written about extensively. But in Surrender, it’s Bono who picks up the
pen, writing for the first time about his remarkable life and those he has
shared it with. In his unique voice, Bono takes us from his early days
growing up in Dublin, including the sudden loss of his mother when he was
fourteen, to U2’s unlikely journey to become one of the world’s most
influential rock bands, to his more than twenty years of activism dedicated
to the fight against AIDS and extreme poverty. Writing with candor, self-
reflection, and humor, Bono opens the aperture on his life—and the family,
friends, and faith that have sustained, challenged, and shaped him.
Surrender’s subtitle, 40 Songs, One Story, is a nod to the book’s forty
chapters, which are each named after a U2 song. Bono has also created forty
original drawings for Surrender, which appear throughout the book.
