*Hardcover*

As a Muslim from birth, I have, of course, read the Holy Quran multiple times. In
adult life I try and read a few lines every day - in Arabic and English. During the
month of Ramadhan, Muslims try and read the whole Quran (in Arabic). I have never
quite managed to do, given the constraints of work and commuting, as well as the
difficulty of reading the Arabic for a non-Arabic speaker. This year, working from
home due to being in lockdown and not having to commute to work, I was able to get
pretty close - I got through about 27 of the 30 parts of the Quran. (I finished
the rest off in the weeks that followed.) Every day, I would read the Arabic for
one "part" and then the English translation.
Reading the whole Quran this way from front to back (rather than dipping in and
out) gives you a better sense of the broader themes in the Quran. You read various
portions of the story of Biblical prophets such Adam, Noah, Abraham, Joseph, Moses,
David and Solomon interweaved with each other. There are non-Biblical stories giving
the example of the peoples of Ad and Thamud and the prophet Saleh. The story of
Mary and Jesus is also mentioned in numerous places in the Quran.
Other than a chapter dedicated to the story of Joseph, the Quran never gives a
complete narrative in one place - instead it uses the  examples of different
prophets in different places to make a point.
Obviously I have some degree of bias, being a Muslim, but I do recommend non-Muslims
to read the Quran with a good translation (such as this one). Although it shares
many of the characters that are in the Bible, the overall feel and flow of the
Quran is very different.
