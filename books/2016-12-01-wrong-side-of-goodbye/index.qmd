Some years back I picked up a Harry Bosch novel and got hooked. I went back and read all the novels from the start and have eagerly read every new release since, plus pretty much everything else that Connelly has written. I'm not particularly a crime-fiction addict but have gotten addicted to Connelly's writing and his characters and the LA setting for his stories. The main character, Harry Bosch, is (over the series of books) so richly drawn that he almost feels real to me. Amazon created the Bosch tv series a few years back, and its pretty good, but doesn't compare to the Bosch that I've built in my head over the years from reading the books.

In the overall body of work, *The Wrong Side of Goodbye* doesn't particularly stand out. For a Connelly fan though, it's essential reading. One of the signs of the quality of the writing for me is that I'm barely conscious of the writing - you just slip into the story and get carried along.
