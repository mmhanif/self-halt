*Publisher's Description*

Have a powerful impactâ€”by being more like yourself rather than less,
through this groundbreaking approach taught at the London School of
Economics and companies worldwide. Organizational psychologist and
executive coach Rebecca Newton has found that even her most successful
clients still want more of one quality: gravitas. They want their words to
carry weight, to have a positive, lasting impact on those around them.
Gravitas can seem like an elusive, intangible quality, but it isn't about
adopting the style of another or being someone you're not. Newton draws on
extensive research and experience coaching business leaders to show what
underpins authentic gravitas and how anyone can develop it. She presents
the counterintuitive idea that in order to be valued, we shouldn't spend
all our time and energy trying to stand out from the crowd; instead, we
should focus on the crowd--connecting with others and understanding their
needs in order to make a significant difference. Newton debunks the myths
of gravitas and gives readers the practical tools to develop it by: *
Minimizing the gaps between intention, action, and impact * Remaining true
to yourself while adapting to work successfully with people who have
different styles * Choosing to be courageous regardless of how confident
you feel--as you engage in courageous behaviors, confidence naturally
builds Authentic gravitas extends beyond commanding presence in the room
during a key meeting; it's about the small things you can do beforehand,
during, and in all the spaces in between--to be someone who genuinely adds
substantive value in the workplace and beyond.
