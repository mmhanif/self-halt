- **Do No Harm: Stories of Life, Death, and Brain Surgery** by Henry Marsh 
- **When Breath Becomes Air** by Paul Kalanithi 
- **Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End** by Atul Gowande 

I read these three books all on a medical theme in a row. They were three of the best books I read all year - all highly recommended. (I actually listened to the audiobook version of all three - I can recommend the audio versions of *Do No Harm* and *Being Mortal*, but found the narrator of *When Breath Becomes Air* to be insufferable - I suggest you stick to the print or ebook version of that book.) They each provide a different viewpoint on life and death, without being overly morose or heavy.
*Do No Harm* is a series of vignettes by retired British neurosurgeon, Dr Henry Marsh. It is a truly compelling read with insights into life, death, medicine, success, failure and much more besides. The author is refreshingly honest about his failures as a surgeon in addition to the soaring successes. I didnt think I'd like it as much as I did. One to go back to again.
*When Breath Becomes Air* ended up on many best-of-2016 lists, and deservedly so. The book is a memoir of a by-all-accounts brilliant young neurosurgeon, nearing the end of his training, who is diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. The author is..was.. a gifted writer as well as a talented surgeon, and it shows in this book. He started writing the book after the diagnosis and died before he could fully complete it. It's a book that forces to think deeply about life, death and everything in between. The title comes from Caelica 83, a poem by Baron Brooke Fulke Greville:

> You that seek what life is in death, 
> Now find it air that once was breath. 
> New names unknown, old names gone:
> Till time end bodies, but souls none.
>             Reader! then make time, while you be, 
>             But steps to your eternity.

*Being Mortal* is an exploration of aging and death, and our society's approach to end-of-life care. I really enjoyed Gowande's book *The Checklist Manifesto* and his occasional articles in *The New Yorker* and thought this book was thought-provoking, moving and eloquent. A must-read, especially for those of us with aging parents, or indeed anyone who hopes to live to an old age.
