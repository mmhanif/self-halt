(*Audible Unabridged, narrated by Steven Kearney*)

I find Joseph Finder novels to be a fun, non-taxing read when I want something with an interesting story that doesnt require too much effort. His novels are generally deeply flawed in terms of plotting - lots of points where you wander why the character didn't do what seems an obvious thing that would get him or her out of trouble - but are executed well. File under fast food.
