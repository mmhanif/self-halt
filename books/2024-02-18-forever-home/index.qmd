*Publisher's Description*

"Wonderful. . . . Dark, funny, full of emotional intelligence and gripping
from the start . . . beautifully written."--Daily Mail The internationally
bestselling author and host of The Graham Norton Show returns with a tense
and darky comic novel that casts a caustic light on the relationship
between mothers and daughters and truth and self-preservation. Where do
secrets live? Carol is a divorced teacher living in a small town in
Ireland, her only son now grown. A second chance at love brings her
unexpected connection and belonging--and sparks a flurry of speculation.
What does a woman like her see in a man like that? What happened to his
wife who abandoned him and his children all those years ago? Carol and
Declan know their relationship is the talk of the town, but the gossip only
serves to bring the couple closer. When Declan becomes ill, their
relationship falters. His children are untrusting and cruel, and Carol is
forced to leave their beloved home, with its worn oak floors and elegant
features, and move back with her parents. Carol's mother is determined to
get to the bottom of things--she won't see her daughter suffer this way. It
seems there are secrets in Declan's past, strange rumors that were never
confronted, and suddenly the house they shared takes on a more sinister
significance that affects them all.
