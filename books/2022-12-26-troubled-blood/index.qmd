**Publisher's Description:**
"While visiting his family in Cornwall, Private Detective Cormoran Strike
agrees to take on a cold case involving a woman who went missing in
mysterious circumstances in 1974, and as Strike and his partner in the
agency, Robin Ellacott, investigate the disappearance, they come up against
a fiendishly complex case with leads that include tarot cards, a
psychopathic serial killer, and witnesses who cannot all be trusted."
