One of my favourite authors, Michael Connelly brings together his veteran character Harry Bosch with LAPD detective Renee Ballard, Connelly's latest creation. If you're a fan of Connelly then this book will not disappoint - Ballard and Bosch work well together and it seems we will probably see a few more books where they team up. At this point though perhaps I'm too familiar with the pattern of Connelly's writing - as soon as the character that turned out to be the villain was introduced, it was easy to guess that he was not just a sideshow but would reappear later in the novel.
