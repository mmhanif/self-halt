*Publisher's Description*

In his best and most ambitious novel yet, Mick Herron, “the le Carré of the
future” (BBC), offers an unsparing look at the corrupt web of media, global
finance, spycraft, and politics that power our modern world. “This is a
darker, scarier Herron. The gags are still there but the satire's more
biting. The privatization of a secret service op and the manipulation of
news is relevant and horribly credible.”—Ann Cleeves, author of the Vera
Stanhope series At Slough House—MI5’s London depository for demoted
spies—Brexit has taken a toll. The “slow horses” have been pushed further
into the cold, Slough House has been erased from official records, and its
members are dying in unusual circumstances, at an unusual clip. No wonder
Jackson Lamb's crew is feeling paranoid. But are they actually targets?
With a new populist movement taking hold of London's streets and the old
order ensuring that everything's for sale to the highest bidder, the
world's a dangerous place for those deemed surplus. Jackson Lamb and the
slow horses are in a fight for their lives as they navigate dizzying layers
of lies, power, and death.
