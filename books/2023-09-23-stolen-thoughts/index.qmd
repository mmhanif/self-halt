*Publisher's Description*

"How would your life change ... if you could read another’s thoughts? If
you were the one ... to break the biological code? There’s been a
breakthrough on the campus of Caltech. A discovery. An invention. One so
startling and surprisingly sinister that the inventor can’t tell a soul.
Precariously poised at the center of the action is Victoria Pixler, a
bioengineering student with a tragic past, a passionate quest, and a
brilliant mind. After a decade of dedication, she’s just completed her
life’s work only to have her dream shattered and her career terminated—by
the least likely suspect. Meanwhile, propelling the thrills from the middle
of the mystery is one of humanity’s great questions: Would the power to
read minds be a blessing, or a curse? Packed with enlightened anecdotes,
amusing quips, and suspense that will rivet readers to their chairs, this
novel delivers Tigner’s trademark fast-paced action and first-class
intellectual intrigue—from characters you can’t forget." --Back cover.
