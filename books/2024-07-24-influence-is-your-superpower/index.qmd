*Publisher's Description*

Rediscover the superpower that makes good things happen, from the professor
behind Yale School of Management's most popular class “The new rules of
persuasion for a better world.”—Charles Duhigg, author of the bestsellers
The Power of Habit and Smarter Faster Better You were born influential. But
then you were taught to suppress that power, to follow the rules, to wait
your turn, to not make waves. Award-winning Yale professor Zoe Chance will
show you how to rediscover the superpower that brings great ideas to life.
Influence doesn’t work the way you think because you don’t think the way
you think. Move past common misconceptions—such as the idea that asking for
more will make people dislike you—and understand why your go-to negotiation
strategies are probably making you less influential. Discover the one thing
that influences behavior more than anything else. Learn to cultivate
charisma, negotiate comfortably and creatively, and spot manipulators
before it’s too late. Along the way, you’ll meet alligators, skydivers, a
mind reader in a gorilla costume, Jennifer Lawrence, Genghis Khan, and the
man who saved the world by saying no. Influence Is Your Superpower will
teach you how to transform your life, your organization, and perhaps even
the course of history. It’s an ethical approach to influence that will make
life better for everyone, starting with you.
