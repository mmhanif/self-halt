> SPQR takes its title from another famous Roman catchphrase, Senatus PopulusQue Romanus, ‘The Senate and People of Rome’.

Interesting enough history of Rome up 212 CE. It does flit back and forth rather than
move through the chronology in a strictly linear fashion. Compared to Mike Duncan's
[The Storm Before The Storm](../2021-05-25-the-storm-before-the-storm/index.qmd),
Beard spends more time on what life was like for the average Roman at various points
in Rome's history. It has a much broader range than Duncan's book, so seems to gloss over
many of the events that Duncan discusses in great detail. I also found Duncan to be
a more engaging writer.

> The message is clear: however far back you go, the inhabitants of Rome were always already from somewhere else.

A sweeping, "magisterial" history of the Roman Empire from one of our
foremost classicists shows why Rome remains "relevant to people many
centuries later" (Atlantic).
