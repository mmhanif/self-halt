I read this book a [few years back](../2018-12-13-mistakes-were-made/index.qmd)
and really enjoyed it. I found out that there was a new edition published in 2020
with an additional chapter discussing the Trump phenomenon. At the same time, I
thought it was a good time to refresh my memory on the main points of the book.

Lots of thought-provoking material on self-justification, cognitive dissonance theory,
confirmation bias, self-justification in the legal system, false "recovered memories",
among other things.

Some great [notes on the book here](https://www.grahammann.net/book-notes/mistakes-were-made-but-not-by-me-carol-tavris-elliot-aronson).
