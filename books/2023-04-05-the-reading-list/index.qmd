A BEST OF SUMMER READ ACCORDING TO NEWSWEEK, PARADE MAGAZINE, NBC NEWS,
LITHUB, AND POPSUGAR! "The most heartfelt read of the summer...a surprising
delight of a novel."--Shondaland An unforgettable and heartwarming debut
about how a chance encounter with a list of library books helps forge an
unlikely friendship between two very different people in a London suburb.
Widower Mukesh lives a quiet life in Wembley, in West London after losing
his beloved wife. He shops every Wednesday, goes to Temple, and worries
about his granddaughter, Priya, who hides in her room reading while he
spends his evenings watching nature documentaries. Aleisha is a bright but
anxious teenager working at the local library for the summer when she
discovers a crumpled-up piece of paper in the back of To Kill a
Mockingbird. It's a list of novels that she's never heard of before.
Intrigued, and a little bored with her slow job at the checkout desk, she
impulsively decides to read every book on the list, one after the other. As
each story gives up its magic, the books transport Aleisha from the painful
realities she's facing at home. When Mukesh arrives at the library,
desperate to forge a connection with his bookworm granddaughter, Aleisha
passes along the reading list...hoping that it will be a lifeline for him
too. Slowly, the shared books create a connection between two lonely souls,
as fiction helps them escape their grief and everyday troubles and find joy
again.
