*Publisher's Description*

"London Rules might not be written down, but everyone knows rule one: Cover
your arse. At MI5 headquarters Regent's Park, First Desk Claude Whelan is
learning this the hard way. Tasked with protecting a beleaguered prime
minister, he's facing attack from all directions himself: from the
showboating MP who orchestrated the Brexit vote, and now has his sights set
on Number Ten; from the showboat's wife, a tabloid columnist, who's
crucifying Whelan in print; from the PM's favorite Muslim, who's about to
be elected mayor of the West Midlands, despite the dark secret he's hiding;
and especially from his own deputy, Lady Di Taverner, who's alert for
Claude's every stumble. Meanwhile, the country's being rocked by an
apparently random string of terror attacks. Over at Slough House, the MI5
satellite office for outcast and demoted spies, the agents are struggling
with personal problems: repressed grief, various addictions, retail
paralysis, and the nagging suspicion that their newest colleague is a
psychopath. Plus someone is trying to kill Roddy Ho. But collectively,
they're about to rediscover their greatest strength - that of making a bad
situation much, much worse"--
