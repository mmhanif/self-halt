when we are playing the Victim or the Villain and how to shift to become
the Hero or the Guide. In his mid-20s, Donald Miller was lost. He was
overweight and poor as a broken piggy bank. Lamenting the cards he was
dealt, Donald was allowing himself to be a victim of circumstance. He knew

responsibility for the choices he was making, beginning the transition from
playing the victim to playing the hero in his life and finding the

everything you do. He lays out the transformational, yet practical plan

motivation, passion, and productivity. The lessons in this book will teach
