**Publisher's Description:**
"For sixty years, Jewish refugees and their descendants have prospered in
the Federal District of Sitka, a "temporary" safe haven created in the wake
of revelations of the Holocaust and the shocking 1948 collapse of the
fledgling state of Israel. Proud, grateful, and longing to be American, the
Jews of the Sitka District have created their own little world in the
Alaskan panhandle, a vibrant, gritty, soulful, and complex frontier city
that moves to the music of Yiddish. For sixty years they have been left
alone, neglected and half-forgotten in a backwater of history. Now the
District is set to revert to Alaskan control, and their dream is coming to
an end: once again the tides of history threaten to sweep them up and carry
them off into the unknown. But homicide detective Meyer Landsman of the
District Police has enough problems without worrying about the upcoming
Reversion. His life is a shambles, his marriage a wreck, his career a
disaster. He and his half-Tlingit partner, Berko Shemets, can't catch a
break in any of their outstanding cases. Landsman's new supervisor is the
love of his life—and also his worst nightmare. And in the cheap hotel where
he has washed up, someone has just committed a murder—right under
Landsman's nose. Out of habit, obligation, and a mysterious sense that it
somehow offers him a shot at redeeming himself, Landsman begins to
investigate the killing of his neighbor, a former chess prodigy. But when
word comes down from on high that the case is to be dropped immediately,
Landsman soon finds himself contending with all the powerful forces of
faith, obsession, hopefulness, evil, and salvation that are his
heritage—and with the unfinished business of his marriage to Bina Gelbfish,
the one person who understands his darkest fears. At once a gripping
whodunit, a love story, an homage to 1940s noir, and an exploration of the
mysteries of exile and redemption, The Yiddish Policemen's Union is a novel
only Michael Chabon could have written."
