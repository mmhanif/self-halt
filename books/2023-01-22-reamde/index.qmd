*Publisher's Description*

From the extraordinary Neal Stephenson comes an epic adventure that spans
entire worlds, both real and virtual. The black sheep of an Iowa farming
clan, former draft dodger and successful marijuana smuggler Richard
Forthrast amassed a small fortune over the years—and then increased it a
thousandfold when he created T'Rain. A massive, multibillion-dollar,
multiplayer online role-playing game, T'Rain now has millions of obsessed
fans from the U.S. to China. But a small group of ingenious Asian hackers
has just unleashed Reamde—a virus that encrypts all of a player's
electronic files and holds them for ransom—which has unwittingly triggered
a war that's creating chaos not only in the virtual universe but in the
real one as well. Its repercussions will be felt all around the
globe—setting in motion a devastating series of events involving Russian
mobsters, computer geeks, secret agents, and Islamic terrorists—with
Forthrast standing at ground zero and his loved ones caught in the
crossfire.
