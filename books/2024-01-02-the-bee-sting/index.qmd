*Audible*

I really enjoyed Murray's earlier books [Skippy Dies](../../books/2020-03-04-skippy-dies/) and [The Mark and the Void](../../books/2016-12-01-mark-and-void/), both set in Ireland as is The Bee Sting. Murray is funny and sees the ironies in modern life. This is probably his darkest book yet. I actually go back and forth on whether I liked this book - overall, I think I did. None of the characters are particularly likeable and all are deeply flawed.

The ending though ... if you read this book, and want to discuss the ending, please reach out and let me know ðŸ˜ƒ

*Publisher's Description*

"The Barnes family is in trouble. Dickie's once-lucrative car business is going under--but rather than face the music, he's spending his days in the woods, building an apocalypse-proof bunker with a renegade handyman. His wife Imelda is selling off her jewelry on eBay, while their teenage daughter Cass, formerly top of her class, seems determined to binge-drink her way through her final exams. And twelve-year-old PJ is putting the final touches to his grand plan to run away from home. Where did it all go wrong? A patch of ice on the tarmac, a casual favor to a charming stranger, a bee caught beneath a bridal veil--can a single moment of bad luck change the direction of a life? And if the story has already been written--is there still time to find a happy ending?"--
