*Publisher's Description*

LAPD Detective Renée Ballard tracks a terrifying serial rapist whose trail
has gone cold, with the help of the newest volunteer to the Open-Unsolved
Unit: Patrol Officer Maddie Bosch, Harry's daughter. Renée Ballard and the
LAPD's Open-Unsolved Unit get a hot shot DNA connection between a recently
arrested man and a serial rapist and murderer who went quiet twenty years
ago. The arrested man is only twenty-three, so the genetic link must be
familial. It is his father who was the Pillowcase Rapist, responsible for a
five-year reign of terror in the city of angels. But when Ballard and her
team move in on their suspect, they encounter a baffling web of secrets and
legal hurdles. Meanwhile, Ballard's badge, gun, and ID are stolen--a theft
she can't report without giving her enemies in the department the
ammunition they need to end her career as a detective. She works the
burglary alone, but her solo mission leads her into greater danger than she
anticipates. She has no choice but to go outside the department for help,
and that leads her to the door of Harry Bosch. Finally, Ballard takes on a
new volunteer to the cold case unit. Bosch's daughter Maddie wants to
supplement her work as a patrol officer on the night beat by investigating
cases with Ballard. But Renée soon learns that Maddie has an ulterior
motive for getting access to the city's library of lost souls.
