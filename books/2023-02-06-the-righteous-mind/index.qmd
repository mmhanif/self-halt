*Publisher's Description*

NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • The acclaimed social psychologist challenges
conventional thinking about morality, politics, and religion in a way that
speaks to conservatives and liberals alike—a “landmark contribution to
humanity’s understanding of itself” (The New York Times Book Review).
Drawing on his twenty-five years of groundbreaking research on moral
psychology, Jonathan Haidt shows how moral judgments arise not from reason
but from gut feelings. He shows why liberals, conservatives, and
libertarians have such different intuitions about right and wrong, and he
shows why each side is actually right about many of its central concerns.
In this subtle yet accessible book, Haidt gives you the key to
understanding the miracle of human cooperation, as well as the curse of our
eternal divisions and conflicts. If you’re ready to trade in anger for
understanding, read The Righteous Mind.
