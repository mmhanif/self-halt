Another book set (at least initially) in a familiar locale, in this case
Princeton, the idea of a mathematical thriller was quite interesting but I
don't think the author pulled it off. There doesn't seem to be anything
remarkable or interesting about the logic tree methodology that the story
claims provides those who master it almost magical abilities. Just couldn't
see it myself. The writing was a bit patchy, so overall a 'meh' rating. 

**Publisher's Description:**
"A Booklife Editor's Pick "Filled with fascinating characters, breathtaking
action... this novel grabs one's interest from page one."-Kat Kennedy, The
US Review of Books Knowledge is power. It is said that the greatest chess
masters can envision a match's outcome ten moves before it occurs. Imagine
a person who can visualize ten steps ahead, not simply in the game of
chess, but in every human interaction. Imagine a person who can see a punch
before it is thrown; who knows what you are going to say before you say it;
who can see every political and economic move long before it happens.
Imagine a secret that can make this all possible. Mathematics professor
Albert Puddles exposes this secret for himself as he is thrust into a
murder investigation on the Princeton campus. The discovery leads Albert to
delve into ancient religious interpretation and unmask new analytical
abilities, all while teaming up with an aging mentor, a curious teaching
assistant, and an elite Book Club on a frantic chase across America to
recover this world-changing knowledge before it falls into dangerous hands.
Albert-now embedded in a national cat-and-mouse political power play-
rediscovers a woman from his past and is forced to confront his own
understanding of love, rationality, power, and the true limits of the human
mind."
