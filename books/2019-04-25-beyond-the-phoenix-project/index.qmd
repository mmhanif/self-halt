Project, intended to be used for reference and to enable further research
of cited material, and not as a standalone work. In the audio series, Gene
Kim and John Willis present a nine-part discussion that includes an oral
history of the DevOps movement, as well as discussions around pivotal
figures and philosophies that DevOps draws upon, from Goldratt to Deming;
from Lean to Safety Culture to Learning Organizations.The book is a great
way for listeners to take an even deeper dive into topics relevant to
DevOps and leading technology organizations."
