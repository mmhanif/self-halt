<p><a href="https://chrislaffra.com/#book"><strong>Communication for Engineers</strong> by Chris Laffra</a></p>

<p><sup>isbn-13: 979-8707037603</sup></p>

<p><em>Paperback</em></p>

<p>This is a great introductory book on communication skills for developers, especially those early in their careers or developers whose career has hit a plateau and they’re not sure why. I’ve given away a copy to every developer on
the teams I supported over the last year. Chris is a former colleague from our Bank of America days on the Quartz
team, and I can attest to Chris being a great communicator.</p>

<p>As Chris explains in his book, only a relatively small fraction of a developer’s impact (say 30% as a rule of thumb) is down to their technical capabilities - a much larger fraction is down to how well they communicate with others. I say “introductory” because the book covers a lot of ground and aims for breadth rather than depth. In many ways the book is a field guide to all the non-technical aspects of what software developer does. Although it introduces a host of theories and mental models, this is a very practical book with a host of actionable tips in each chapter of what to do or not to do.</p>

<p>Despite being most useful for early career developers, even more seasoned professionals can gain valuable tips and insights from the book. This is a self-published book, so don’t expect the polish of say an O’Reilly book and the numerous links that Chris provides work better on the kindle version than the hardcopy version.</p>
