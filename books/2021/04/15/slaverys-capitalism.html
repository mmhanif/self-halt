<p><strong>Slavery’s Capitalism</strong> by Sven Beckert, Seth Rockman</p>

<p><sup>isbn-13: 9780812248418</sup></p>

<p><em>Audible</em></p>

<p><a href="/books/2019/04/08/the-half-has-never-been-told.html">The Half Has Never Been Told</a>
by Edward Baptist was an eye-opening book about the reality of slavery in America
and how it was the foundation for American economic success in 19th century.</p>

<p>Slavery’s Capitalism doesn’t provide the same impact, being a collection of essays
about different aspects of the slave trade in the Americas. It does provide some
additional context and detail but some chapters are definitely more compelling
than others.</p>

of the modern world.”</p>
