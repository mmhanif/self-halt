<p><strong>Mythos</strong> by Stephen Fry</p>

<p>Although familiar in general with many Greek myths, I have never really read them
in depth. This was an enjoyable dive into Greek mythology especially with Fry’s
excellent narration. Those Greeks were wild!</p>

<p><strong>Publisher’s Description:</strong>
“The Greek myths are amongst the greatest stories ever told, passed down
through millennia and inspiring writers and artists as varied as
Shakespeare, Michelangelo, James Joyce and Walt Disney. They are embedded
deeply in the traditions, tales and cultural DNA of the West. You’ll fall
in love with Zeus, marvel at the birth of Athena, wince at Cronus and
Gaia’s revenge on Ouranos, weep with King Midas and hunt with the beautiful
and ferocious Artemis. Spellbinding, informative and moving, Stephen Fry’s
Mythos perfectly captures these stories for the modern age - in all their
rich and deeply human relevance.”</p>
