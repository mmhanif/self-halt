<p><strong>The Making Of A Manager</strong> by Julie Zhuo</p>

<p>Julie Zhuo is a former manager at Facebook, and as I was going to be joining Facebook
later in the year I thought I might get some insight into Facebook’s management
philosophy. Unfortunately I don’t think I got any deep insights. Overall this book
is good for someone relatively new to management or someone who hasn’t read many
management books.</p>

<p><strong>Publisher’s Description:</strong>
“Instant Wall Street Journal Bestseller! Congratulations, you’re a manager!
After you pop the champagne, accept the shiny new title, and step into this
thrilling next chapter of your career, the truth descends like a fog: you
don’t really know what you’re doing. That’s exactly how Julie Zhuo felt
when she became a rookie manager at the age of 25. She stared at a long
list of logistics–from hiring to firing, from meeting to messaging, from
planning to pitching–and faced a thousand questions and uncertainties. How
was she supposed to spin teamwork into value? How could she be a good
steward of her reports’ careers? What was the secret to leading with
confidence in new and unexpected situations? Now, having managed dozens of
teams spanning tens to hundreds of people, Julie knows the most important
lesson of all: great managers are made, not born. If you care enough to be
reading this, then you care enough to be a great manager. The Making of a
Manager is a modern field guide packed everyday examples and transformative
insights, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How to tell a great manager from an average manager
(illustrations included)</li>
  <li>When you should look past an awkward interview
and hire someone anyway</li>
  <li>How to build trust with your reports through not
being a boss</li>
  <li>Where to look when you lose faith and lack the answers</li>
</ul>

<p>Whether you’re new to the job, a veteran leader, or looking to be promoted,
this is the handbook you need to be the kind of manager you wish you had.”</p>
