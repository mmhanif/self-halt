<p><strong>SPQR</strong> by Mary Beard</p>

<p><sup>isbn-13: 9781631492228</sup></p>

<p><em>Audible</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>SPQR takes its title from another famous Roman catchphrase, Senatus PopulusQue Romanus, ‘The Senate and People of Rome’.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Interesting enough history of Rome up 212 CE. It does flit back and forth rather than
move through the chronology in a strictly linear fashion. Compared to Mike Duncan’s
<a href="/books/2021/05/25/the-storm-before-the-storm.html">The Storm Before The Storm</a>,
Beard spends more time on what life was like for the average Roman at various points
in Rome’s history. It has a much broader range than Duncan’s book, so seems to gloss over
many of the events that Duncan discusses in great detail. I also found Duncan to be
a more engaging writer.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The message is clear: however far back you go, the inhabitants of Rome were always already from somewhere else.</p>

A sweeping, “magisterial” history of the Roman Empire from one of our
foremost classicists shows why Rome remains “relevant to people many
centuries later” (Atlantic).</p>
