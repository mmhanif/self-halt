<p><strong>Funny In Farsi</strong> by Firoozeh Dumas</p>

<p><sup>isbn-13: 9780812968378</sup></p>

<p><em>Audible</em></p>

<p>Mildly amusing memoir of an Iranian family’s American immigrant experience. A
series of stories and anecdotes many of them revolving around the eccentricities
of the author’s father. Some quite funny stories, some a little twee. Somehow the
book didn’t really resonate with me the way I thought it would.</p>

<p><strong>Publisher’s Description:</strong>
“NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • Finalist for the PEN/USA Award in Creative
Nonfiction, the Thurber Prize for American Humor, and the Audie Award in
Biography/Memoir This Random House Reader’s Circle edition includes a
reading group guide and a conversation between Firoozeh Dumas and Khaled
Hosseini, author of The Kite Runner! “Remarkable . . . told with wry humor
shorn of sentimentality . . . In the end, what sticks with the reader is an
exuberant immigrant embrace of America.”—San Francisco Chronicle In 1972,
when she was seven, Firoozeh Dumas and her family moved from Iran to
Southern California, arriving with no firsthand knowledge of this country
beyond her father’s glowing memories of his graduate school years here.
More family soon followed, and the clan has been here ever since. Funny in
Farsi chronicles the American journey of Dumas’s wonderfully engaging
family: her engineer father, a sweetly quixotic dreamer who first sought
riches on Bowling for Dollars and in Las Vegas, and later lost his job
during the Iranian revolution; her elegant mother, who never fully mastered
English (nor cared to); her uncle, who combated the effects of American
fast food with an army of miraculous American weight-loss gadgets; and
Firoozeh herself, who as a girl changed her name to Julie, and who
encountered a second wave of culture shock when she met and married a
Frenchman, becoming part of a one-couple melting pot. In a series of deftly
drawn scenes, we watch the family grapple with American English (hot dogs
and hush puppies?—a complete mystery), American traditions (Thanksgiving
turkey?—an even greater mystery, since it tastes like nothing), and
American culture (Firoozeh’s parents laugh uproariously at Bob Hope on
television, although they don’t get the jokes even when she translates them
into Farsi). Above all, this is an unforgettable story of identity,
discovery, and the power of family love. It is a book that will leave us
all laughing—without an accent. Praise for Funny in Farsi “Heartfelt and
hilarious—in any language.”—Glamour “A joyful success.”—Newsday “What’s
charming beyond the humor of this memoir is that it remains affectionate
even in the weakest, most tenuous moments for the culture. It’s the
brilliance of true sophistication at work.”—Los Angeles Times Book Review
“Often hilarious, always interesting . . . Like the movie My Big Fat Greek
Wedding, this book describes with humor the intersection and overlapping of
two cultures.”—The Providence Journal “A humorous and introspective
chronicle of a life filled with love—of family, country, and
heritage.”—Jimmy Carter “Delightfully refreshing.”—Milwaukee Journal
Sentinel “[Funny in Farsi] brings us closer to discovering what it means to
be an American.”—San Jose Mercury News”</p>
