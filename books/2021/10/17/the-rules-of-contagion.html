<p><strong>The Rules Of Contagion Why Things Spread - And Why They Stop</strong> by Adam Kucharski</p>

<p><sup>isbn-13: 9781541674318</sup></p>

<p><em>Audible</em></p>

<p>This book was published just before Covid-19 hit but still has some relevant lessons
for us today. It doesn’t just discuss viral contagion, but also financial crises,
viral online contents and the spread of ideas. The author is a mathematician and
professor of epedemiology.</p>

<p>Overall, an interesting but not essential read. Perhaps would have been a better
book to actually read rather than listen to on Audible.</p>

<p>Some takeaways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Every outbreak is unique. While some outbreaks spread quickly, others ebb off just as fast.</li>
  <li>Mathematical models help show the growth of epidemics.</li>
  <li>Contagions can affect many industries, including the financial industry.</li>
  <li>Contagions can also spread through your social circle.</li>
  <li>Gun violence may be a type of behavior that’s socially contagious.</li>
  <li>Social behavior online may be different from real life. Abusive “trolling” behavior is common.</li>
  <li>Using big data can help with outbreak research but it’s not a panacea.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Publisher’s Description:</strong>
“From ad servers to Zika, Ebola to fake news, why the science of infection
is the science of modern life In our social-media-laden lives, everyone
thinks they understand how things, whether YouTube fads or bank failures,
spread: they go viral. In The Rules of Contagion, Adam Kucharski unpacks
the science of epidemiology – the movement of diseases – to reveal what
is, and isn’t, viral in modern life. Is it true that fake news spreads
because it’s an unstoppable mind virus? Actually, brute-force attacks on
our attention, not manipulation, explain most of it. Exploring everything
from the onset of riots to the power of Instagram influencers, Kucharski
shows how hackneyed the popular understanding of virality can be, and how
much more compelling the real story is. Whether you are an author seeking
an audience, a defender of the truth, or simply someone interested in the
science of human social behavior, The Rules of Contagion is essential guide
to modern life.”</p>
