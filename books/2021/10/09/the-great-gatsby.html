<p><strong>The Great Gatsby</strong> by Francis Scott Fitzgerald</p>

<p><sup>isbn-13: 9780684801520</sup></p>

<p><em>Audible</em></p>

<p>It had been many years since I read The Great Gatsby and this audible version
narrated by Jake Gyllenhaal was an opportunity to re-acquaint myself with this
classic American novel.</p>

<p>I know many people consider this to be a literary jewel, but while I admired
the skill of the writer and the story was reasonably engaging it didn’t really
move me in the way it seems to move others. Undoubtedly some deficiency in my
literary tastes and education.</p>

<p><strong>Publisher’s Description:</strong>
“A young man newly rich tries to recapture the past and win back his former
love, despite the fact she has married”</p>
