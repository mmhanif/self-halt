<p><strong>Ready Player One</strong> by Ernest Cline</p>

<p><sup>isbn-13: 9780307887436</sup></p>

<p><em>Audible</em></p>

<p>I really enjoyed this trip into the ‘metaverse’ along with all its 1980’s
nostalgia. It’s not high art, but it was fun.</p>

<p>Don’t bother with the movie though, it’s rubbish.</p>

<p><strong>Publisher’s Description:</strong>
“Immersing himself in a mid-21st-century technological virtual utopia to
escape an ugly real world of famine, poverty and disease, Wade Watts joins
an increasingly violent effort to solve a series of puzzles by the virtual
world’s super-wealthy creator, who has promised that the winner will be his
heir. (This book was previously listed in Forecast.)”</p>
