<p><strong>The Storm Before The Storm</strong> by Michael Duncan</p>

<p><sup>isbn-13: 9781610397216</sup></p>

<p><em>Audible</em></p>

<p>Fascinating backstory to the more familiar events surrounding the rise of
Julius Caesar and the end of the Republic. After listening to this audiobook it
becomes clear that the ‘purity’ of the Roman Republic was always somewhat precarious.</p>

<p>This book introduces characters such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaius_Marius">Gaius Marius</a>
who was consul an unprecedented seven times and hailed as “the third founder of Rome”,
and his nemesis <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulla">Sulla</a>. We learn of the
<em>optimates</em>, supporters of the continued authority of the senate, and <em>populares</em>,
those who favoured the cause of the plebeians (the commoners) along with the
struggles between the <em>patricians</em> and those considered <em>novus homo</em> (new man).</p>

<p>The main downside of the audiobook version is the difficulty in distinguishing
between all the different <em>Gaius</em> and <em>Lucius</em> and <em>Quintus</em> characters.</p>

<p><strong>Publisher’s Description:</strong>
“The Roman Republic was one of the most remarkable achievements in the
history of civilization. After its founding in 509 BCE, Rome grew from an
unremarkable Italian city-state to the dominant superpower of the
Mediterranean world. Through it all, the Romans never allowed a single man
to seize control of the state. Every year for four hundred years the
annually elected consuls voluntarily handed power to their successors. Not
once did a consul give in to the temptation to grab absolute power and
refuse to let it go. It was a run of political self-denial unmatched in the
history of the world. The disciplined Roman republicans then proceeded to
explode out of Italy and conquer a world filled with petty tyrants,
barbarian chieftains, and despotic kings. But the very success of the
Republic proved to be its undoing. The republican system was unable to cope
with the vast empire Rome ruled. Bankrolled by mountains of imperial wealth
and without a foreign enemy to keep them united, ambitious Roman leaders
began to stray from the republican austerity of their ancestors. Almost as
soon as they had conquered the Mediterranean, Rome would become engulfed in
violent political conflicts and civil wars that would destroy the Republic
less than a century later. The Storm Before the Storm tells the story of
the beginning of the end of the Roman Republic–the story of the first
generation that had to cope with the dangerous new political environment
made possible by Rome’s unrivaled domination over the known world. The
tumultuous years from 133-80 BCE set the stage for the fall of the
Republic. The Republic faced issues like rising economic inequality,
increasing political polarization, the privatization of the military,
endemic social and ethnic prejudice, rampant corruption, ongoing military
quagmires, and the ruthless ambition and unwillingness of elites to do
anything to reform the system in time to save it–a situation that draws
many parallels to present-day America. These issues are among the reasons
why the Roman Republic would fall. And as we all know, those who do not
learn from history are doomed to repeat it.”</p>
