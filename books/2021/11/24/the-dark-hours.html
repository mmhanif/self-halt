<p><strong>The Dark Hours</strong> by Michael Connelly</p>

<p><sup>isbn-13: 9780316485647</sup></p>

<p><em>Audible</em></p>

<p>I read everything Michael Connelly pretty much as soon as he publishes it. This
latest novel that teams up Renee Ballard and Harry Bosch doesn’t fail to please.
As with everything Connelly does, you get engrossed in the story and characters
very quickly. I always find a learn something new about LA and its culture with
each Connelly book and this is no exception.</p>

<p><strong>Publisher’s Description:</strong>
