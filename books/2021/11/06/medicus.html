<p><strong>Medicus</strong> by Ruth Downie</p>

<p><sup>isbn-13: 9781596912311</sup></p>

<p><em>Audible</em></p>

<p>Slow moving but mildly engaging novel set in Roman Britain. The narration with a
variety of posh and not so posh English accents as well as the language and
mannerisms of the characters gave it the air of a 19th century British period
drama teleported to Roman Britain.</p>

<p>The first in a fairly lengthy series with the same main characters. Unfortunately
not enough here in the first novel to entice me into continuing with the series.</p>

<p><strong>Publisher’s Description:</strong>
“Gaius Petrius Ruso is a divorced and down-on his luck army doctor who has
made the rash decision to seek his fortune in an inclement outpost of the
Roman Empire, namely Britannia. His arrival in Deva (more commonly known as
Chester, England) does little to improve his mood, and after a straight
thirty six hour shift at the army hospital, he succumbs to a moment of
weakness and rescues an injured slave girl, Tilla, from the hands of her
abusive owner. Now he has a new problem: a slave who won’t talk and can’t
cook, and drags trouble in her wake. Before he knows it, Ruso is caught in
the middle of an investigation into the deaths of prostitutes working out
of the local bar. A few years earlier, after he rescued Emperor Trajan from
an earthquake in Antioch, Ruso seemed headed for glory: now he’s living
among heathens in a vermin-infested bachelor pad and must summon all his
forensic knowledge to find a killer who may be after him next. Who are the
true barbarians, the conquered or the conquerors? It’s up to Ruso—certainly
the most likeable sleuth to come out of the Roman Empire—to discover the
truth. With a gift for comic timing and historic detail, Ruth Downie has
conjured an ancient world as raucous and real as our own. Published in the
UK as Medicus (Ruso) and the Disappearing Dancing Girls.”</p>
