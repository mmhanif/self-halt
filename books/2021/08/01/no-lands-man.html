<p><strong>No Land’s Man</strong> by Aasif Mandvi</p>

<p><sup>isbn-13: 9781452107912</sup></p>

<p><em>Audible</em></p>

<p>A memoir by “Indo-Muslim-British-American” actor Aasif Mandvi.
Like <a href="/books/2021/06/21/funny-in-farsi.html">Funny in Farsi</a> much is
made of the eccentricities of the author’s father.</p>

<p>I enjoyed reading this and gained a new appreciation for Mandvi but strangely
he doesn’t ‘click’ with me. Perhaps the way he and I see the world is just too
far out of sync.</p>

<p><strong>Publisher’s Description:</strong>
““It always bothered me that Aasif was more than merely funny-he’s also a
great actor. Now I’ve learned he’s an amazing storyteller as well, and I am
furious . . . but also grateful. Aasif’s movement between cultures and
genres is what makes him and his story singularly funny, poignant, and
essential.” - John Hodgman, author of The Areas of My Expertise and More
Information Than You Require “My father moved our family to the United
States because of a word. It was a word whose meaning fascinated him. It
was a singularly American word, a fat word, a word that could only be
spoken with decadent pride. That word was . . . Brunch! ‘The beauty of
America,’ he would say, ‘is they have so much food, that between breakfast
and lunch they have to stop and eat again.’” —from “International House of
Patel” If you’re an Indo-Muslim-British-American actor who has spent more
time in bars than mosques over the past few decades, turns out it’s a
little tough to explain who you are or where you are from. In No Land’s Man
Aasif Mandvi explores this and other conundrums through stories about his
family, ambition, desire, and culture that range from dealing with his
brunch-obsessed father, to being a high-school-age Michael Jackson
impersonator, to joining a Bible study group in order to seduce a nice
Christian girl, to improbably becoming America’s favorite
Muslim/Indian/Arab/Brown/Doctor correspondent on The Daily Show with Jon
Stewart. This is a book filled with passion, discovery, and humor. Mandvi
hilariously and poignantly describes a journey that will resonate with
anyone who has had to navigate his or her way in the murky space between
lands. Or anyone who really loves brunch.”</p>
