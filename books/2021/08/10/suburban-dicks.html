<p><strong>Suburban Dicks</strong> by Fabian Nicieza</p>

<p><sup>isbn-13: 9780593191262</sup></p>

<p><em>Audible</em></p>

<p>The main attraction of this book for me is that it is set in the township that I
live, West Windsor, NJ. It’s fun to have scenes set in locations close to home
that you know well. For example, the book starts with a murder at the Valero
gas station on Princeton-Hightstown Road which is where I typically go to fill up.</p>

<p>It helps that the author, Fabian Nicieza, is an accomplished writer and keeps the
book moving along at a cracking pace.</p>

<p><strong>Publisher’s Description:</strong>
“From the cocreator of Deadpool comes a hilariously entertaining debut
featuring two unlikely and unforgettable amateur sleuths. An engrossing and
entertaining murder mystery full of skewering social commentary, Suburban
Dicks examines the racial tensions exposed in a New Jersey suburb after the
murder of a gas station attendant. Andie Stern thought she’d solved her
final homicide. Once a budding FBI profiler, she gave up her career to
raise her four (soon to be five) children in West Windsor, New Jersey. But
one day, between soccer games, recitals, and trips to the local pool, a
very pregnant Andie pulls into a gas station–and stumbles across a murder
scene. An attendant has been killed, and the bumbling local cops are in way
over their heads. Suddenly, Andie is obsessed with the case, and back on
the trail of a killer, this time with kids in tow. She soon crosses paths
with disgraced local journalist Kenneth Lee, who also has everything to
prove in solving the case. A string of unusual occurrences–and,
eventually, body parts–surface around town, and Andie and Kenneth uncover
simmering racial tensions and a decades-old conspiracy. Hilarious,
insightful, and a killer whodunit, Suburban Dicks is the one-of-a-kind
mystery that readers will not be able to stop talking about.”</p>
