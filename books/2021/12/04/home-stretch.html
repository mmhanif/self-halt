<p><strong>Home Stretch</strong> by Graham Norton</p>

<p><sup>isbn-13: 9780063112094</sup></p>

<p><em>Audible</em></p>

<p>This is my third Graham Norton novel after <a href="/books/2019/08/10/a-keeper.html">A Keeper</a>
and <a href="/books/2019/02/28/holding.html">Holding</a> but probably my least
favorite of the trio. Perhaps it was because the first two were mysteries of a
sort whereas this is more of a family drama. There is a mystery to be revealed here
as well, but it’s all reasonably predictable.</p>

<p><strong>Publisher’s Description:</strong>
“In this “compelling, bighearted, emotionally precise page-turner” (Sunday
Times), the New York Times bestselling writer and acclaimed television host
explores the aftermath of a tragedy on a small-town to illuminate the shame
and longing that can flow through generations–and how the secrets of the
heart cannot stay be buried forever. It is 1987 and a small Irish community
is preparing for a wedding. The day before the ceremony, a group of young
friends, including the bride and groom, are involved in an accident. Three
survive. Three are killed. The lives of the families are shattered and the
rifts between them ripple throughout the small town. Connor survived, but
living among the angry and the mourning is almost as hard as carrying the
shame of having been the driver. He leaves the only place he knows for
another life, taking his secrets with him. Travelling first to Liverpool,
then London, he eventually makes a home–of sorts–for himself in New York,
where he finds shelter and the possibility of forging a new life. But the
secrets–the unspoken longings and regrets that have come to haunt those
left behind–will not be silenced. Before long, Connor will have to
confront his past. A powerful and timely novel of emigration and return,
Home Stretch demonstrates Norton’s keen understanding of the power of
stigma and secrecy–and their devastating effect on ordinary lives.”</p>
