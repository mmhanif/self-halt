<p><strong>Once Upon A Time In Russia</strong> by Ben Mezrich</p>

<p>The story of the rise and fall of Boris Berezovsky and the Russian oligarchs.
Fascinating story, told in Mezrich’s typical breathless style. They’re all a
bunch of unsavory characters though so this book fails to land any emotional
impact other than a feeling of distaste.</p>

<p><strong>Publisher’s Description:</strong>
“The bestselling author of Bringing Down the House (sixty-three weeks on the
New York Times bestseller list and the basis for the hit movie 21) and The
Accidental Billionaires (the basis for the Academy Award–winning film The
Social Network) delivers an epic drama of wealth, rivalry, and betrayal
among mega-wealthy Russian oligarchs—and its international repercussions.
Once Upon a Time in Russia is the untold true story of the larger-than-life
billionaire oligarchs who surfed the waves of privatization to reap riches
after the fall of the Soviet regime: “Godfather of the Kremlin” Boris
Berezovsky, a former mathematician whose first entrepreneurial venture was
running an automobile reselling business, and Roman Abramovich, his dashing
young protégé who built a multi-billion-dollar empire of oil and aluminum.
Locked in a complex, uniquely Russian partnership, Berezovsky and
Abramovich battled their way through the “Wild East” of Russia with
Berezovsky acting as the younger man’s krysha—literally, his roof, his
protector. Written with the heart-stopping pacing of a thriller—but even
more compelling because it is true—this story of amassing obscene wealth
and power depicts a rarefied world seldom seen up close. Under Berezovsky’s
krysha, Abramovich built one of Russia’s largest oil companies from the
ground up and in exchange made cash deliveries—including 491 million
dollars in just one year. But their relationship frayed when Berezovsky
attacked President Vladimir Putin in the media—and had to flee to the UK.
Abramovich continued to prosper. Dead bodies trailed Berezovsky’s
footsteps, and threats followed him to London, where an associate of his
died painfully and famously of Polonium poisoning. Then Berezovsky himself
was later found dead, declared a suicide. Exclusively sourced, capturing a
momentous period in recent world history, Once Upon a Time in Russia is at
once personal and political, offering an unprecedented look into the
wealth, corruption, and power behind what Graydon Carter called “the story
of our age.””</p>
