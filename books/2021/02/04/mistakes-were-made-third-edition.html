<p><strong>Mistakes Were Made Third Edition</strong> by Carol Tavris, Elliot Aronson</p>

<p>I read this book a <a href="/books/2018/12/13/mistakes-were-made.html">few years back</a>
and really enjoyed it. I found out that there was a new edition published in 2020
with an additional chapter discussing the Trump phenomenon. At the same time, I
thought it was a good time to refresh my memory on the main points of the book.</p>

<p>Lots of thought-provoking material on self-justification, cognitive dissonance theory,
confirmation bias, self-justification in the legal system, false “recovered memories”,
among other things.</p>

<p>Some great <a href="https://www.grahammann.net/book-notes/mistakes-were-made-but-not-by-me-carol-tavris-elliot-aronson">notes on the book here</a>.</p>
