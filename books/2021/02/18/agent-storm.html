<p><strong>Agent Storm</strong> by Morten Storm, Paul Cruickshank, Tim Lister (Journalist)</p>

<p><sup>isbn-13: 9780802123145</sup></p>

<p><em>Audible</em></p>

<p>Eye-opening inside view of how both Jihadist organizations and intelligence organizations
recruit and operate. Don’t expect to get any deep insights to Islam as a faith.
As a practising Muslim I think it was interesting how Morten goes from a life of
petty crime to a strict Muslim but without really going through any spiritual
transformation. His leaving (his version of) Islam, is equally abrupt.</p>

<p><strong>Publisher’s Description:</strong>
“A Danish national-turned-associate of al-Qaida, provides an inside look at
his decade as a radical Islamist, as well as his ultimate decision to leave
the jihadist life and become a double-agent for the CIA and British and
Danish intelligence. 35,000 first printing.”</p>
