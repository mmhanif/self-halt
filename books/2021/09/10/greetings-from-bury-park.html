<p><strong>Greetings From Bury Park</strong> by Sarfraz Manzoor</p>

<p><sup>isbn-13: 9780747592945</sup></p>

<p><em>Audible</em></p>

<p>I really enjoyed this memoir of a young British-Pakistani growing up in 1970s
and 80s Luton. The author is only slightly older than me, and certain aspects of
his experience did resonate with me although in most details we had quite
different childhoods. This is another memoir where the eccentric father looms
large in the narrative. The other twist to the this particular coming of age
story is the author’s obsession with Bruce Springsteen.</p>

<p><strong>Publisher’s Description:</strong>
“Sarfraz Manzoor Was Two Years Old When His Family Emigrated From Pakistan
To Join His Father In Bury Park, Luton. His Teenage Years Were A Constant
Battle To Reconcile Being Both British And Muslim. But When His Best Friend
Introduced Him To Bruce Springsteen, His Life Changed For Ever. In This
Affectionate And Timely Memoir, Manzoor Retraces His Journey From The
Frustrations Of His Childhood To His Reaction To The Tragedies Of 9/11 And
7/7. Original, Darkly Tender And Wryly Amusing, This Is An Inspiring
Tribute To The Power Of Music To Transcend Race And Religion And A Moving
Account Of A Relationship Between Father And Son.”</p>
