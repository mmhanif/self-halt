<p><strong>Sophia Of Silicon Valley</strong> by Anna Yen</p>

<p><sup>isbn-13: 9780062673015</sup></p>

<p><em>Kindle</em></p>

<p>This was an enjoyable tale of a young woman’s rise in the world of Silicon Valley
technology companies. Part of the fun is figuring out who the thinly disguised
characters actually represent, though to be fair it’s not too hard, and aligning
the events in the novel with the real-life career timeline of the author.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Scott Kraft = Steve Jobs</li>
  <li>Treehouse = Pixar</li>
  <li>Andre Stark = Elon Musk</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Publisher’s Description:</strong>
“Sharp, dramatic, and full of insider dish, SOPHIA OF SILICON VALLEY is one
woman’s story of a career storming the corridors of geek power and living
in the shadow of its outrageous cast of maestros. During the heady years of
the tech boom, incorrigibly frank Sophia Young lucks into a job that puts
her directly in the path of Scott Kraft, the eccentric CEO of Treehouse, a
studio whose animated films are transforming movies forever. Overnight,
Sophia becomes an unlikely nerd whisperer. Whether her success is due to
dumb luck, savage assertiveness, insightful finesse (learned by dealing
with her irrational Chinese immigrant mother), or a combination of all
three, in her rarified position she finds she can truly shine. As Scott
Kraft’s right-hand woman, whip-smart Sophia is in the eye of the storm,
sometimes floundering, sometimes nearly losing relationships and her
health, but ultimately learning what it means to take charge of her own
future the way the men around her do. But when engineer/inventor Andre
Stark hires her to run his company’s investor relations, Sophia discovers
that the big paycheck and high-status career she’s created for herself may
not be worth living in the toxic environment of a boys-club gone bad.”</p>
