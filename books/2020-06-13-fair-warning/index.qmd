**Publisher's Description:**

"The hero of The Poet and The Scarecrow is back in the new thriller from #1
New York Times bestselling author Michael Connelly. Jack McEvoy, the
journalist who never backs down, tracks a serial killer who has been
operating completely under the radar--until now. Veteran reporter Jack
McEvoy has taken down killers before, but when a woman he had a one-night
stand with is murdered in a particularly brutal way, McEvoy realizes he
might be facing a criminal mind unlike any he's ever encountered. McEvoy
investigates---against the warnings of the police and his own editor---and
makes a shocking discovery that connects the crime to other mysterious
deaths across the country. But his inquiry hits a snag when he himself
becomes a suspect. As he races to clear his name, McEvoy's findings point
to a serial killer working under the radar of law enforcement for years,
and using personal data shared by the victims themselves to select and hunt
his targets. Called "the Raymond Chandler of this generation" (Associated
Press), Michael Connelly once again delivers an unputdownable thriller that
reveals a predator operating from the darkest corners of human nature---and
one man courageous and determined enough to stand in his way."
