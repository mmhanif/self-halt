## Introduction

*Get In: The Inside Story of Labour Under Starmer*, co-authored by Patrick Maguire and Gabriel Pogrund, offers a definitive, behind-the-scenes account of the Labour Party’s transformation from its historic defeat in 2019 to its landslide election victory in 2024. The narrative focuses less on Keir Starmer himself and more on the machinery and operatives behind him, particularly his chief of staff and campaign director, Morgan McSweeney [1]. The book portrays McSweeney as the central protagonist and a "modern-day Machiavelli" who orchestrated a ruthless and disciplined operation to rebuild the party as a merciless vote-winning machine [1]. It argues that this period marks a shift from the "Blair/Brown" era, where leaders drove strategy, to a new model where the political machine drives the leader [1].

## Overview of the Key Points

The book details several significant revelations about the internal workings of the Labour Party during this period. One of the most striking disclosures is Keir Starmer’s "wobble" following the humiliating Hartlepool by-election defeat in 2021. The authors reveal that Starmer was distraught and told close aides, "I think I have to go… We’re going backwards," bringing him to the brink of resignation before being persuaded to stay [1].

Another key aspect of the narrative is the role of *Labour Together*, McSweeney’s organization. The book describes it as starting as a "confidence trick" designed to destabilize Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership from within while masquerading as a benign think tank [1]. This operation culminated in strategic maneuvers such as the 2021 party conference rule changes, which are characterized as a secretly planned "ambush" intended to permanently weaken the left wing of the party [1].

The dynamic between Starmer and his aides is also a major focus. Sources in the book describe Starmer as sometimes acting like a "pawn in a chess game" or a "driverless train" controlled by his strategists, with one aide remarking that he acts "like an HR manager, not a leader" [1]. The book also chronicles the brutal internal power struggle between McSweeney and Starmer’s former Chief of Staff, Sue Gray, depicting Gray as a "power-hoarding control freak" who was ultimately outmaneuvered [1]. Additionally, it is suggested that Starmer’s 2020 leadership campaign pledges were ghostwritten and viewed merely as tools to win the leadership rather than binding principles [1].

## Overview of the Key Themes

**Ruthlessness and the Pursuit of Power**
The "single all-consuming principle" of the Starmer project is identified as winning. The book illustrates how promises and principles were readily discarded if they were perceived as hindrances to electoral success [1].

**Betrayal of the Left**
A recurring theme is the deliberate and systematic dismantling of the Corbynite faction. The strategists viewed the left wing not just as political opponents within the party, but as an existential threat that needed to be "eviscerated" to ensure the party's survival and electability [1].

**The Machine vs. The Leader**
The book explores the shift in political power dynamics, showing how the political operative (McSweeney) held as much, if not more, strategic agency than the elected leader (Starmer). This highlights a new era of political management where the "machine" is paramount [1].

**Discipline over Democracy**
The transformation of the Labour Party is shown to rely heavily on tight control, secrecy, and the marginalization of internal dissent. The narrative suggests that the path to victory was paved by prioritizing strict party discipline over broad internal democracy [1].

## Conclusion

*Get In* provides a granular and often unvarnished look at the mechanics of political rehabilitation. It presents a party that successfully clawed its way back from irrelevance through cold calculation and the relentless drive of its backroom staff. While it chronicles a successful path to power, it also raises questions about the cost of that success in terms of internal democracy and ideological consistency.
