*Publisher's Description*

#1 SUNDAY TIMES BESTSELLER • A “vivid” (Financial Times) rags-to-riches
memoir that takes readers inside the high-stakes drama and hubris of the
trading floor, a “darkly funny” (Guardian) tale of Citibank’s one-time most
profitable trader, and why he gave it all up “Darker than [Liar’s Poker],
but if anything even more of a rollicking read . . . the clearest account
I’ve ever read of how trading desks really work.”—Felix Salmon, Axios In
development as a limited series • Longlisted for the FT and Schroders
Business Book of the Year If you were gonna rob a bank and you saw the
vault door there, left open, what would you do? Would you wait around? Ever
since he was a kid, kicking broken soccer balls on the run-down streets of
East London, Gary Stevenson dreamed of something bigger. As luck would have
it, he was good at numbers. At the London School of Economics, wearing
tracksuits and sneakers, Stevenson shocked his posh classmates by winning a
competition called “The Trading Game.” The prize?: a golden ticket to a new
life, as the youngest trader at Citibank. A place where you could make more
money than you’d ever imagined. Where your colleagues are dysfunctional
geniuses and insecure bullies yet start to feel like family. Where against
the odds you become the bank’s most profitable trader, closing deals worth
nearly a trillion dollars. A day. Soon you are dreaming of numbers in your
sleep—and then you stop sleeping at all. But what happens when winning
starts to feel like losing? You’re making a killing betting on millions of
people becoming poorer—like the very people you grew up with. The economy
is slipping off a precipice, and your own sanity starts slipping with it.
You want to stop, but you can’t. Because nobody ever leaves. Would you
stick, or quit? Even if it meant risking everything? The Trading Game is an
outrageous, unvarnished, white-knuckle journey to the dark heart of an
intoxicating world—the trading floor—from someone who survived the game and
then blew it all wide open.
