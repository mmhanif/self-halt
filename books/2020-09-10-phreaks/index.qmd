*Audible*

Short listen from Audible with a full cast including Christian Slater. Set in the days before the internet, when Ma Bell ruled the phone lines and the proto-hackers
of the day were obsessed with figuring out how to break into the network.
Certainly not an essential listen, but not a waste of time either.
