<p><strong>The Night Fire</strong> by Michael Connelly</p>

<p>“Harry Bosch and LAPD Detective Renee Ballard come together again on the
murder case that obsessed Bosch’s mentor, the man who trained him—new
from #1 New York Times bestselling author Michael Connelly Back when Harry
Bosch was just a rookie homicide detective, he had an inspiring mentor who
taught him to take the work personally and light the fire of relentlessness
for every case. Now that mentor, J.J. Thompson, is dead, but after his
funeral his widow hands Bosch a murder book that Thompson took with him
when he left the LAPD 20 years before – the unsolved killing of a troubled
young man in an alley used for drug deals. Bosch brings the murder book to
Renée Ballard and asks her to help him find what about the case lit
Thompson’s fire all those years ago. That will be their starting point. The
bond between Bosch and Ballard tightens as they become a formidable
investigation team. And they soon arrive at a worrying question: Did
Thompson steal the murder book to work the case in retirement, or to make
sure it never got solved?”</p>
