<p><strong>A knight of the seven kingdoms</strong> by George R.R. Martin</p>

<p>“NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER Taking place nearly a century before the events
of A Game of Thrones, A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms compiles the first
three official prequel novellas to George R. R. Martin’s ongoing
masterwork, A Song of Ice and Fire. These never-before-collected adventures
recount an age when the Targaryen line still holds the Iron Throne, and the
memory of the last dragon has not yet passed from living consciousness.
Before Tyrion Lannister and Podrick Payne, there was Dunk and Egg. A young,
naïve but ultimately courageous hedge knight, Ser Duncan the Tall towers
above his rivals–in stature if not experience. Tagging along is his
diminutive squire, a boy called Egg–whose true name is hidden from all he
and Dunk encounter. Though more improbable heroes may not be found in all
of Westeros, great destinies lay ahead for these two . . . as do powerful
foes, royal intrigue, and outrageous exploits. Featuring more than 160 all-
new illustrations by Gary Gianni, A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms is a must-
have collection that proves chivalry isn’t dead–yet.”</p>
