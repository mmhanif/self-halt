<p><strong>Wrecked</strong> by Joe Ide</p>

<p><sup>isbn-13: 9780316509510</sup></p>

<p><em>Audible</em></p>

<p>“Isaiah Quintabe–IQ for short–has never been more successful, or felt more
alone. A series of high-profile wins in his hometown of East Long Beach
have made him so notorious that he can hardly go to the corner store
without being recognized. Dodson, once his sidekick, is now his full-
fledged partner, hell-bent on giving IQ’s PI business some real legitimacy:
a Facebook page, and IQ’s promise to stop accepting Christmas sweaters and
carpet cleanings in exchange for PI services. So when a young painter
approaches IQ for help tracking down her missing mother, it’s not just the
case Isaiah’s looking for, but the human connection. And when his new
confidant turns out to be connected to a dangerous paramilitary operation,
IQ falls victim to a threat even a genius can’t see coming. Waiting for
Isaiah around every corner is Seb, the Oxford-educated African gangster who
was responsible for the death of his brother, Marcus. Only, this time,
Isaiah’s not alone. Joined by a new love interest and his familiar band of
accomplices, IQ is back–and the adventures are better than ever.”</p>
