<p><strong>Millions, Billions, Zillions</strong> by Brian W. Kernighan</p>

<p><sup>isbn-13: 9780691182773</sup></p>

<p><em>Hardcover</em></p>

<p>“An essential guide to recognizing bogus numbers and misleading data Numbers
are often intimidating, confusing, and even deliberately
deceptive—especially when they are really big. The media loves to report on
millions, billions, and trillions, but frequently makes basic mistakes or
presents such numbers in misleading ways. And misunderstanding numbers can
have serious consequences, since they can deceive us in many of our most
important decisions, including how to vote, what to buy, and whether to
make a financial investment. In this short, accessible, enlightening, and
entertaining book, leading computer scientist Brian Kernighan teaches
anyone—even diehard math-phobes—how to demystify the numbers that assault
us every day. With examples drawn from a rich variety of sources, including
journalism, advertising, and politics, Kernighan demonstrates how numbers
can mislead and misrepresent. In chapters covering big numbers, units,
dimensions, and more, he lays bare everything from deceptive graphs to
speciously precise numbers. And he shows how anyone—using a few basic ideas
and lots of shortcuts—can easily learn to recognize common mistakes,
determine whether numbers are credible, and make their own sensible
estimates when needed. Giving you the simple tools you need to avoid being
fooled by dubious numbers, Millions, Billions, Zillions is an essential
survival guide for a world drowning in big—and often bad—data.”</p>
