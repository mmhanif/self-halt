<p><strong>Give and Take: Why Helping Others Drives Our Success</strong> by Adam M. Grant</p>

<p>This book was recommended by a former manager - it was actually required pre-reading for a management “offsite”. It turned out to be a great read and very thought provoking.</p>

<p>Grant postulates that people fall in to three distinct categories of interpersonal dealing: Takers, Matchers and Givers. Takers take more than they give, Matchers give and take proportionally and conditionally, Givers give more than they take. According to the book, long-lasting success accrues to givers more than to takers or matchers.</p>

<p>I liked the book and it had some great stories; my only negative is that its hard to pinpoint many concrete takeaways on how to behave differently. Also, I would imagine few people self-identify as takers (or even matchers) so there’s a temptation for people to come away from reading the book feeling good about being a giver and not really changing anything as a result.</p>
