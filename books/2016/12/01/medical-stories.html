<ul>
  <li><strong>Do No Harm: Stories of Life, Death, and Brain Surgery</strong> by Henry Marsh</li>
  <li><strong>When Breath Becomes Air</strong> by Paul Kalanithi</li>
  <li><strong>Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End</strong> by Atul Gowande</li>
</ul>

<p>I read these three books all on a medical theme in a row. They were three of the best books I read all year - all highly recommended. (I actually listened to the audiobook version of all three - I can recommend the audio versions of <em>Do No Harm</em> and <em>Being Mortal</em>, but found the narrator of <em>When Breath Becomes Air</em> to be insufferable - I suggest you stick to the print or ebook version of that book.) They each provide a different viewpoint on life and death, without being overly morose or heavy.</p>

<p><em>Do No Harm</em> is a series of vignettes by retired British neurosurgeon, Dr Henry Marsh. It is a truly compelling read with insights into life, death, medicine, success, failure and much more besides. The author is refreshingly honest about his failures as a surgeon in addition to the soaring successes. I didnt think I’d like it as much as I did. One to go back to again.</p>

<p><em>When Breath Becomes Air</em> ended up on many best-of-2016 lists, and deservedly so. The book is a memoir of a by-all-accounts brilliant young neurosurgeon, nearing the end of his training, who is diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. The author is..was.. a gifted writer as well as a talented surgeon, and it shows in this book. He started writing the book after the diagnosis and died before he could fully complete it. It’s a book that forces to think deeply about life, death and everything in between. The title comes from Caelica 83, a poem by Baron Brooke Fulke Greville:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You that seek what life is in death, 
Now find it air that once was breath. 
New names unknown, old names gone:
Till time end bodies, but souls none.
            Reader! then make time, while you be, 
            But steps to your eternity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Being Mortal</em> is an exploration of aging and death, and our society’s approach to end-of-life care. I really enjoyed Gowande’s book <em>The Checklist Manifesto</em> and his occasional articles in <em>The New Yorker</em> and thought this book was thought-provoking, moving and eloquent. A must-read, especially for those of us with aging parents, or indeed anyone who hopes to live to an old age.</p>
