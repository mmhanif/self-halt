<p><strong>The Mark and the Void: A Novel</strong> by Paul Murray</p>

<p>I listened to the audiobook of Paul Murray’s preious book, <em>Skippy Dies</em>, a few years ago and absolutely loved it. The writing was wonderful but the full cast reading of the audiobook was truly stellar.</p>

<p>I got the audiobook version of <em>The Mark and the Void</em> and was a little disappointed to see (hear?) that there was only a single narrator. Luckily, he turned out to be very good. The book is set in post-financial crisis Dublin, but a Dublin almost stripped of it’s Irishness and populated by a multinational jet-set elite who never venture far from the International Finacial Center district. There’s lots of biting criticism here of the excesses of the financial world both pre and post-crisis. The story is more of a farce than I remember <em>Skippy Dies</em> being and didn’t quite hit the hights of that book for me. Still all in all, enjoyable read.</p>
