<p><strong>Radical Focus: Achieving Your Most Important Goals with Objectives and Key Results</strong> by Christina Wodtke</p>

<p>This is a quick and easy introduction to OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) - a performance management system that’s popular in Silicon Valley. The book is another one of those ‘business fables’ (a la Patrick Lencioni) that gets its points across via a fictional story. As for most of these books, dont expect a work of art, but its an effective way to get information across and more enjoyable than reading a dry treatise on a management topic. At the end the book has a section that reviews the model presented in the ‘fable’.</p>

<p>I like the concept of OKRs and they seem like a simple yet effective way to set goals for a team or organization.</p>

<h3 id="model">Model</h3>

<p><strong>O = Objective</strong> This is what you want to accomplish. Should be qualitative and inspirational, make you want to get out of bed in the morning.</p>

<p><strong>KR = Key Results</strong> These are how you know you’ve achieved your objective. They should be quantitative stretch targets (difficult to achieve, but not impossible). Each KR starts out with a 50% confidence level that it will be achieved. The confidence level is adjusted every week to indicate how close to achieving the KR you are.</p>

<p>OKRs are set at the company or team level either annually or quartlerly. For small companies/teams, a single OKR is preferable; 2-3 are probably acceptable for a larger organization; 5 is too many to remember and track.</p>

<p><strong>Health Metrics</strong> These are metrics you want to protect while achieving your OKRs.</p>

<p><strong>Weekly Priorities</strong> These are the 3 to 5 things you need to do each week to help achieve the OKRs. They are marked as P1 - must do, - and P2 - should do.</p>
