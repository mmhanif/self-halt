<p><strong>The Ideal Team Player: How to Recognize and Cultivate The Three Essential Virtues</strong> by Patrick Lencioni</p>

<p>I’m a big fan of Patrick Lencioni and have read almost all his books. Most of them are in the form of ‘business fables’ - they have a fictional plot through which a particular model related to management or leadership is presented. Each book typically also has a section where the model is also presented in a more conventional manner. I found the books easy to read and a good way of conveying the message that Lencioni is trying to deliver. It’s perhaps not everyone’s cup-of-tea, but it works for me.</p>

<p><em>The Ideal Team Player</em> is perhaps not his best work, but nevertheless a worthwhile read with some interesting points to make. I wouldn’t start here if you are coming fresh to Lencioni (I would recommend trying <em>Five Dysfunctions of Team</em> first) but if you have read his other books, you’ll likely enjoy this too.</p>

<p><strong>The Three Virtues</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li><em>Humility</em>: Humility is the single most important attribute of a team player. Great team players lack excessive ego or concerns about status. The share credit, emphasize team over self, and define success collectively rather than individually.</li>
  <li><em>Hunger</em>: Hungry people almost never need to be pushed by a manager to work harder because they are self-motivated and diligent.</li>
  <li><em>People Smarts</em>: Smart refers to a person’s common sense about people. It is the ability to be interpersonally approriate and aware.</li>
</ol>

<p>An ideal team player has all three virtues combined. If even one virtue is missing, teamwork becomes much more difficult if not impossible.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Humble only: <em>The Pawn</em></li>
  <li>Hungry only: <em>The Bulldozer</em></li>
  <li>Smart only: <em>The Charmer</em></li>
  <li>Hungry and Humble, but not Smart: <em>The Accidental Mess-Maker</em></li>
  <li>Humble and Smart, but not Hungry: <em>The Lovable Slacker</em></li>
  <li>Hungry and Smart, but not Humble: <em>The Skillful Politician</em></li>
</ul>
