*Publisher's Description*

What if WWII went the other way? "SS-GB" imagines a chiilling alternative
world where British Command surrendered to the Nazis, Churchill has been
shot, the King is in the dungeon, and the SS are in Whitehall. In Scotland
Yard, Detective Inspector Archer is assigned to a seemingly routine murder
case--until SS Standartenfuhrer Huth arrives with orders from Himmler
himself to supervise the investigation. This is a spy story different from
any other--one that only Deighton could have written.
