*Publisher's Description*

In this one-of-a-kind retelling of Pride and Prejudice set in modern-day
Pakistan, Alys Binat has sworn never to marry--until an encounter with one
Mr. Darsee at a wedding makes her reconsider. A scandal and vicious rumor
concerning the Binat family have destroyed their fortune and prospects for
desirable marriages, but Alys, the second and most practical of the five
Binat daughters, has found happiness teaching English literature to
schoolgirls. Knowing that many of her students won't make it to graduation
before dropping out to marry and have children, Alys teaches them about
Jane Austen and her other literary heroes and hopes to inspire the girls to
dream of more. When an invitation arrives to the biggest wedding their
small town has seen in years, Mrs. Binat, certain that their luck is about
to change, excitedly sets to work preparing her daughters to fish for rich,
eligible bachelors. On the first night of the festivities, Alys's lovely
older sister, Jena, catches the eye of Fahad "Bungles" Bingla, the wildly
successful--and single--entrepreneur. But Bungles's friend Valentine Darsee
is clearly unimpressed by the Binat family. Alys accidentally overhears his
unflattering assessment of her and quickly dismisses him and his snobbish
ways. As the days of lavish wedding parties unfold, the Binats wait
breathlessly to see if Jena will land a proposal--and Alys begins to
realize that Darsee's brusque manner may be hiding a very different man
from the one she saw at first glance. Told with wry wit and colorful prose,
Unmarriageable is a charming update on Jane Austen's beloved novel and an
exhilarating exploration of love, marriage, class, and sisterhood. Advance
praise for Unmarriageable "[A] funny, sometimes romantic, often thought-
provoking glimpse into Pakistani culture, one which adroitly illustrates
the double standards women face when navigating sex, love, and marriage.
This is a must-read for devout Austenites."--Publishers Weekly (starred
review) "Unmarriageable is a joy to read! It transforms a familiar story
into something new and fresh and different, but keeps all of the warmth and
intelligence of the original. I loved everything about these characters and
spending time in their world."--Jasmine Guillory, author of The Wedding
Date "Unmarriageable raises an eyebrow at a society that views marriage as
the ultimate prize for women. Crackling with witty dialogue, family
tensions, humor, and rich details of life in contemporary Pakistan, it
tells an entirely new story about love, luck, and literature."--Balli Kaur
