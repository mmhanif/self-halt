The follow-up to 'Orconomics' and in many ways even more enjoyable.

**Publisher's Description:**
"A doubly disgraced Dwarven hero. A band of accident-prone adventurers.
Giving redemption a second shot may have been a grave mistake... If you
like rib-tickling shenanigans, second-rate heroes, and imaginative new
takes on tired tropes, then you'll love J. Zachary Pike's hilarious blend
of finance and high fantasy."
