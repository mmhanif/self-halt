(*Audible Unabridged, narrated by Therese Plummer*)

I loved Sloan's last work, "Mr Penumbra's 24-hour Bookstore" and so was greatly looking forward to this new novel. It's fairly quirky and I found the initial chapters of the book the most enjoyable. As it went on the plot started to drag a bit with the ending not wholly satisfying. Worth a read.
