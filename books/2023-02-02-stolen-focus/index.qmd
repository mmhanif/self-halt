NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • Our ability to pay attention is collapsing.
From the New York Times bestselling author of Chasing the Scream and Lost
Connections comes a groundbreaking examination of why this is happening—and
how to get our attention back. “The book the world needs in order to win
the war on distraction.”—Adam Grant, author of Think Again “Read this book
to save your mind.”—Susan Cain, author of Quiet ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF
THE YEAR: The Wall Street Journal In the United States, teenagers can focus
on one task for only sixty-five seconds at a time, and office workers
average only three minutes. Like so many of us, Johann Hari was finding
that constantly switching from device to device and tab to tab was a
diminishing and depressing way to live. He tried all sorts of self-help
solutions—even abandoning his phone for three months—but nothing seemed to
work. So Hari went on an epic journey across the world to interview the
leading experts on human attention—and he discovered that everything we
think we know about this crisis is wrong. We think our inability to focus
is a personal failure to exert enough willpower over our devices. The truth
is even more disturbing: our focus has been stolen by powerful external
forces that have left us uniquely vulnerable to corporations determined to
raid our attention for profit. Hari found that there are twelve deep causes
of this crisis, from the decline of mind-wandering to rising pollution, all
of which have robbed some of our attention. In Stolen Focus, he introduces
readers to Silicon Valley dissidents who learned to hack human attention,
and veterinarians who diagnose dogs with ADHD. He explores a favela in Rio
de Janeiro where everyone lost their attention in a particularly surreal
way, and an office in New Zealand that discovered a remarkable technique to
restore workers’ productivity. Crucially, Hari learned how we can reclaim
our focus—as individuals, and as a society—if we are determined to fight
for it. Stolen Focus will transform the debate about attention and finally
show us how to get it back.
