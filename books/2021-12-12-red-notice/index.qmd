*Audible*

This was great book with a very compelling story. It starts out like just another
"how I got rich" story, but evolves into something quite different.

The story details the corruption that blossomed as Russia was reborn from the
ashes of the USSR and then was co-opted by the state under Putin's rule. It reads
like a thriller with many twists and turns. The tenaciousness of Browder is admirable
as he morphs from a financier and businessman to a human-rights activist.

A must-read if you want to understand the corruption at the heart of the modern
Russian state.
