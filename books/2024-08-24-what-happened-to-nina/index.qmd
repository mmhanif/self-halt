*Publisher's Description*

From the #1 internationally bestselling author of The Murder Rule comes an
emotional novel of suspense about two families pitted against each other--
one seeking justice in the disappearance of their daughter, the other
desperate to clear their son's name. Nina and Simon are the perfect couple.
Young, fun and deeply in love. Until they leave for a weekend at his
family's cabin in Vermont, and only Simon comes home. WHAT HAPPENED TO
NINA? Nobody knows. Simon's explanation about what happened in their last
hours together doesn't add up. Nina's parents push the police for answers,
and Simon's parents rush to protect him. They hire expensive lawyers and a
PR firm that quickly ramps up a vicious, nothing-is-off-limits media
campaign. HOW FAR WILL HIS FAMILY GO TO KEEP HIM SAFE? Soon, facts are lost
in a swirl of accusation and counter-accusation. Everyone chooses a side,
and the story goes viral, fueled by armchair investigators and wild
conspiracy theories and illustrated with pretty pictures taken from Nina's
social media accounts. Journalists descend on their small Vermont town,
followed by a few obsessive "fans." Nina's family is under siege, but they
never lose sight of the only thing that really matters -- finding their
daughter. Out-gunned by Simon's wealthy, powerful family, Nina's parents
recognize that if playing by the rules won't get them anywhere, it's time
to break them. HOW FAR WILL HER FAMILY GO TO GET TO THE TRUTH?
