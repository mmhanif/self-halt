(*Audible Unabridged, narrated by Mohsin Hamid*)

This book by Mohsin Hamid won awards and was included in many top books of 2017 lists. However, it didn't really click with me. The writing was beautiful in parts, but the overall tone just felt dreary and monotonous. This might have had something to do with the fact that I listed to the audibook version which was narrated by the author himself. Perhaps a more experienced narrator could have put a bit more life into it. 

I think it was worth a read/listen and definitely gives you some insight into what it feels like to live in a war-torn middle-eastern country before veering off onto a more surreal path with the premise that portals appear all over the world connecting the third-world to the first. 

For me the novel appealed on an intellectual level but rarely on an emotional level.
