*Publisher's Description*

“An ardent fan letter from Hornby that makes you want to re-read Great
Expectations while listening to Sign o’ the Times.” —Vogue From the
bestselling author of Just Like You, High Fidelity, and Fever Pitch, a
short, warm, and entertaining book about art, creativity, and the unlikely
similarities between Victorian novelist Charles Dickens and modern American
rock star Prince Every so often, a pairing comes along that seems
completely unlikely—until it’s not. Peanut butter and jelly, Dennis Rodman
and Kim Jong Un, ducks and puppies, and now: Dickens and Prince. Equipped
with a fan’s admiration and his trademark humor and wit, Nick Hornby
invites us into his latest obsession: the cosmic link between two unlikely
artists, geniuses in their own rights, spanning race, class, and
centuries—each of whom electrified their different disciplines and whose
legacy resounded far beyond their own time. When Prince’s 1987 record Sign
o’ the Times was rereleased in 2020, the iconic album now came with dozens
of songs that weren’t on the original— Prince was endlessly prolific,
recording 102 songs in 1986 alone. In awe, Hornby began to wonder, Who else
ever produced this much? Who else ever worked that way? He soon found his
answer in Victorian novelist and social critic Charles Dickens, who died
more than a hundred years before Prince began making music. Examining the
two artists’ personal tragedies, social statuses, boundless productivity,
and other parallels, both humorous and haunting, Hornby shows how these two
unlikely men from different centuries “lit up the world.” In the process,
he creates a lively, stimulating rumination on the creativity, flamboyance,
discipline, and soul it takes to produce great art.
