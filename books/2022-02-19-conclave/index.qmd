**Publisher's Description:**
"The best-selling author of Enigma and Fatherland turns to today's Vatican
in a ripped-from-the-headlines novel, and gives us his most ambitious,
page-turning thriller yet--where the power of God is nearly equaled by the
ambition of men. The pope is dead. Behind the locked doors of the Sistine
Chapel, one hundred and eighteen cardinals from all over the globe will
cast their votes in the world's most secretive election. They are holy men.
But they have ambition. And they have rivals. Over the next seventy-two
hours one of them will become the most powerful spiritual figure on Earth."
