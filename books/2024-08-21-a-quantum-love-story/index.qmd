*Publisher's Description*

The only thing harder than finding someone in a time loop is losing them.
Grieving her best friend's recent death, neuroscientist Mariana Pineda's
ready to give up everything to start anew. Even her career--after one last
week consulting at a top secret particle accelerator. Except the strangest
thing happens: a man stops her...and claims they've met before. Carter Cho
knows who she is, why she's mourning, why she's there. And he needs Mariana
to remember everything he's saying. Because time is about to loop. In a
flash of energy, it's Monday morning. Again. Together, Mariana and Carter
enter an inevitable life, four days at a time, over and over, without
permanence except for what they share. With everything resetting--even bank
accounts--joy comes in the little moments: a delicious (and expensive)
meal, a tennis match, giving a dog his favorite treat. In some ways, those
are all that matter. But just as they figure out this new life, everything
changes. Because Carter's memories of the time loop are slowly
disappearing. And their only chance at happiness is breaking out of the
loop--forever.
