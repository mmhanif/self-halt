Discover insider secrets of how America’s transportation system is
designed, funded, and built – and how to make it work for your community In
Confessions of a Recovering Engineer: Transportation for a Strong Town,
renowned speaker and author of Strong Towns Charles L. Marohn Jr. delivers
an accessible and engaging exploration of America’s transportation system,
laying bare the reasons why it no longer works as it once did, and how to
modernize transportation to better serve local communities. You’ll discover
real-world examples of poor design choices and how those choices have
dramatic and tragic effects on the lives of the people who use them. You’ll
also find case studies and examples of design improvements that have
revitalized communities and improved safety. This important book shows you:
The values of the transportation professions, how they are applied in the
design process, and how those priorities differ from those of the public.
How the standard approach to transportation ensures the maximum amount of
traffic congestion possible is created each day, and how to fight that
congestion on a budget. Bottom-up techniques for spending less and getting
higher returns on transportation projects, all while improving quality of
life for residents. Perfect for anyone interested in why transportation
systems work – and fail to work – the way they do, Confessions of a
Recovering Engineer is a fascinating insider’s peek behind the scenes of
America’s transportation systems.
