*Publisher's Description*

From the acclaimed, controversial singer-songwriter Sinéad O'Connor comes a
revelatory memoir of her fraught childhood, musical triumphs, fearless
activism, and of the enduring power of song. Blessed with a singular voice
and a fiery temperament, Sinéad O'Connor rose to massive fame in the late
1980s and 1990s with a string of gold records. By the time she was twenty,
she was world famous--living a rock star life out loud. From her trademark
shaved head to her 1992 appearance on Saturday Night Live when she tore up
Pope John Paul II's photograph, Sinéad has fascinated and outraged
millions. In Rememberings, O'Connor recounts her painful tale of growing up
in Dublin in a dysfunctional, abusive household. Inspired by a brother's
Bob Dylan records, she escaped into music. She relates her early forays
with local Irish bands; we see Sinéad completing her first album while
eight months pregnant, hanging with Rastas in the East Village, and soaring
to unimaginable popularity with her cover of Prince's "Nothing Compares
2U." Intimate, replete with candid anecdotes and told in a singular form
true to her unconventional career, Sinéad's memoir is a remarkable
chronicle of an enduring and influential artist.
