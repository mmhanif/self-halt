A compellingly heartbreaking debut novel about the echoes of Partition and
four friends whose dark secrets lead to a life-changing night that comes
back to haunt them decades later. One night. Four friends. Countless
secrets. 1964. Karachi, Pakistan. Rozeena is running out of time. She'll
lose her home—her parents' safe haven since fleeing India and the terrors
of Partition—if her medical career doesn't take off soon. But success may
come with an unexpected price. Meanwhile the interwoven lives of her
childhood best friends—Haaris, Aalya, and Zohair—seem to be unraveling with
each passing day. The once small and inconsequential differences between
their families' social standing now threaten to divide them. Then one
fateful night someone ends up dead and the life they once took for granted
shatters. 2019. Rozeena receives a call from a voice she never thought
she’d hear again. What begins as an ask to look after a friend’s teenaged
granddaughter struggling with her own demons grows into an unconventional
friendship—one that unearths buried secrets and just might ruin everything
Rozeena has worked so hard to protect. Captivating and atmospheric, Under
the Tamarind Tree shows us the high-stakes ripple effects of generational
trauma, and the lengths people will go to protect the ones they love.
