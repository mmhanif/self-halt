I hit my [Goodreads Reading Challenge of 50](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/26167086)
for the first time after a number of years falling short. If you want to, you
can [jump straight to the list here](#y2021).

My view of the best of those 50 books. Hit the link for each book for some
additional notes and information about each.

## [Top of the Pops](https://youtu.be/LWiKV7onnzc)

The three books I read in 2021 that had the strongest emotional impact on me were:
- [Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality]({%- post_url books/2021-01-23-harry-potter-and-the-methods-of-rationality -%}): Not a conventional book at all, this was a work of [fan-fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fan_fiction)
that was published entirely online (I downloaded the epub version of it). By far
the longest 'book' I read this year (probably the equivalent of five volumes of
the [actual Harry Potter Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter)).
- [A Place For Us]({%- post_url books/2021-07-30-a-place-for-us -%}): An immigrant
story and a coming of age story that affected me strongly.
- [Red Notice]({%- post_url  books/2021-12-12-red-notice -%}): A whirlwind story of greed and corruption
amongst the oligarchs and officials of post-communist Russia.

## [Change (You Can Change)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0kGo_x12DQ)
I read a few different books on the topic of change. The best was
[Think Again]({%- post_url books/2021-12-28-think-again -%}) by Adam Grant.
[How We Change]({%- post_url books/2021-07-24-how-we-change -%}) looked at the
subject from a psychotherapists point of view. [Better]({%- post_url books/2021-10-08-better -%})
is about trying to make things better in the medical world.
[Mistakes Were Made (But Not By Me)]({%- post_url books/2021-02-04-mistakes-were-made-third-edition -%})
was updated last year to add a chapter on the Trump phenomenon - a very interesting book
about self-deception, cognitive dissonance and why people don't change their mind even in the
face of clear evidence. I also started [How To Change](https://www.amazon.com/How-Change-Science-Getting-Where-ebook/dp/B08KPFPSNS) but didn't manage to finish it before the end of the year.

## [I Remember That](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7VurhK2kos)
I read quite a few memoirs, especially ones focused on growing up as an
immigrant. My favorite was [Greetings from Bury Park]({%- post_url books/2021-09-10-greetings-from-bury-park -%})
by Sarfraz Manzoor. The others were [No Land's Man]({%- post_url books/2021-08-01-no-lands-man -%}),
[Somebody's Daughter]({%- post_url books/2021-07-09-somebodys-daughter -%}) and
[Funny in Farsi]({%- post_url books/2021-06-21-funny-in-farsi -%}). Also worth
mentioning in this category is [Sophia Of Silicon Valley]({%- post_url books/2021-07-13-sophia-of-silicon-valley -%})
a novel which is in fact a thinly-veiled memoir of the author's time working with
Steve Jobs and Elon Musk.

## [Time After Time](https://youtu.be/fQot1WBA7ng)
I'm always drawn to time-travel books - its probably my favorite science-fiction
sub-genre. [A Gift of Time]({%- post_url books/2021-07-04-a-gift-of-time -%}) and
[All Our Wrong Todays]({%- post_url books/2021-04-28-all-our-wrong-todays -%}) were
both excellent.

## [Good Technology](https://youtu.be/Cs0OkiCZNRI)
[Kill Process]({%- post_url books/2021-06-26-kill-process -%}) is a techno-thriller
that actually gets the technology right.

## [Mad World](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1ZvPSpLxCg)
[The Premonition]({%- post_url books/2021-12-23-the-premonition -%}) by Michael
Lewis was a damning indictment of the inaction of the CDC during the Covid-19
pandemic and of the US health system at large.

## [Rome (If You Want To)](https://youtu.be/iNwC0sp-uA4)
Ever since reading Robert Harris' excellent [Cicero Trilogy](https://www.amazon.com/The-Cicero-Trilogy/dp/1786332922)
I have found myself wanting to know more about Roman history. Both
[The Storm Before The Storm]({%- post_url books/2021-05-25-the-storm-before-the-storm -%})
and [SPQR]({%- post_url books/2021-06-14-spqr -%}) were accessible entry points to
the broad sweep of Roman politics. I also read [Medicus]({%- post_url books/2021-11-06-medicus -%})
a murder mystery set in Roman Britain which was ... okay.

## [Friends (I'll Be There For You)](https://youtu.be/SCQGnVrTsAM)
A couple of friends and former colleagues published (separately) two exellent
books this year - please go out and buy them:
- [Communication For Engineers]({%- post_url books/2021-04-19-communication-for-engineers -%}) by Chris Laffra
- [The Accidental Sexist]({%- post_url books/2021-06-03-the-accidental-sexist -%}) by Stephen Koch et al.

## [Its The End Of The World As We Know It (And I Feel Fine)](https://youtu.be/Z0GFRcFm-aY)
Some fun, sometimes funny, novels about superheroes, telekenesis and the metaverse
among other things:
- [The Sidekicks Initiative]({%- post_url books/2021-10-23-the-sidekicks-initiative -%})
- [Orlando People]({%- post_url books/2021-10-10-orlando-people -%}) and
[Dade County Death Cruise]({%- post_url books/2021-12-27-dade-county-death-cruise -%})
- [Ready Player One]({%- post_url books/2021-05-17-ready-player-one -%})

## [Don't You (Forget About Me)](https://youtu.be/CdqoNKCCt7A)
Some miscellaneous good reads:
- [Numbers Don't Lie]({%- post_url books/2021-10-01-numbers-dont-lie -%})
- [The Nine Lives Of Pakistan]({%- post_url books/2021-02-21-the-nine-lives-of-pakistan -%})
- [Mythos]({%- post_url books/2021-03-18-mythos -%})
- [The Right It]({%- post_url books/2021-05-10-the-right-it -%})

Overall I read slightly more non-fiction books this year than fiction. I think
this was helped by the number of memoirs I read. Audible was far and away my
input source of choice.
