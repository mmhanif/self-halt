Reaching out to LinkedIn contacts to send them greeting
- started with a few and snowballed - give stats
- LinkedIn tools rubbish, downloaded contact details
- filtered people I didnt know personally
- heartwarming response, great to hear from colleagues from years past

One nagging thought - what if someone had passed away
Morbid thought tragically realized on Dec 28 when I heard news that Andy Bishop
had passed away on Christmas Eve.
Had messaged him but was not expecting a response as he was was not a big user ]
of social media. Was going to dig out mobile number to text him

Friend, colleague and mentor as well as my boss in three different companies
Took over BID system and then later followed him onto the Kapital system.
We both joined Cygnifi and then would both end up at Bank of America.
Quintessential Englishman - very polite, friendly but somewhat reserved. Always
had time for a question - I would badger him about derivatives and finance but was
always patient in his response. At the time I lived in Earlsfield and he lived in
Wimbledon - we'd often share a taxi home after working late or a team dinner.

Always very calm, seldom saw him lose his cool. I think he had a positive impact
on all those who worked with him.

Last time we spoke was over the phone a few years back when he had gone in to
retirement in Cornwall.

I am now doubly glad I made the effort to reconnect with my network. Social networks
get a bad rep and LinkedIn in particular is looked down on by some. It has many
deficiencies, but its one key value is a place to keep connected with people you
have worked with. Its easy to lose touch, contact details change. Close friends I
connect with directly over the phone, Facetime, WhatsApp. Those who I'm comfortable
blurring the work-home boundary with I connect with one Facebook. But the rest,
a much bigger network than all others added together is on LinkedIn.

Pinging those personal contacts every now and then is important. Ive been working
for more than 30 years now. Over that time Ive met many many people and shared
good times and tough times with them. Will try to keep up that connection.
