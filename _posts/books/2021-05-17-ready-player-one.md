**Ready Player One** by Ernest Cline

<sup>isbn-13: 9780307887436</sup>

*Audible*

I really enjoyed this trip into the 'metaverse' along with all its 1980's
nostalgia. It's not high art, but it was fun.

Don't bother with the movie though, it's rubbish.

**Publisher's Description:**
"Immersing himself in a mid-21st-century technological virtual utopia to
escape an ugly real world of famine, poverty and disease, Wade Watts joins
an increasingly violent effort to solve a series of puzzles by the virtual
world's super-wealthy creator, who has promised that the winner will be his
heir. (This book was previously listed in Forecast.)"
