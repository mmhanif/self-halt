**A Gift Of Time** by Jerry Merritt

<sup>isbn-13: 9780989432153</sup>

*Audible*

I'm a sucker for time-travel books and this is one of two great time-travel books
I've read this year - the other being [A Gift of Time]({% post_url books/2021-07-04-a-gift-of-time %}).
Both of them take some effort to think through (in their own ways) some of the
practical questions around time travel - e.g. do your clothes travel with you? what
if you materialize into a solid object? etc.

*A Gift of Time* is the deeper, more broody of the two books. The story spends a
good chunk of its time (no pun intended) in 1950's and 60's America - these parts
of the book reminded me of Stephen King's brilliant [11/22/63](https://www.amazon.com/11-22-63-Stephen-King-ebook/dp/B004Q7CIFI) in its atmospheric evocation of fifties Americana.

The ending was a bit meh, but still a tremendously enjoyable book overall. 

**Publisher's Description:**
"When Micajah Fenton discovers a crater in his front yard with a broken time
glider in the bottom and a naked, virtual woman on his lawn, he delays his
plans to kill himself. While helping repair the marooned time traveler's
glider, Cager realizes it can return him to his past to correct a mistake
that had haunted him his whole life. In gratitude for his help, the virtual
creature living in the circuitry of the marooned glider, sends Cager back
in time as his ten-year-old self, knowing everything he'd known at eighty.
As a bonus, it also gives him access to advanced equations of space and
time.But living life over knowing the future isn't as easy as Cager
anticipated, and he bungles his chance at correcting the most serious
mistake of his life. Now he must use his new knowledge of advanced math to
build his own time machine to go back and try again. Meanwhile Cager's
repairs to the creature's glider fail, keeping it stranded near earth. In
desperation, the whale-like creature sends, Ell, a near-human, female copy
containing it's consciousness to help Cager. While perfecting time travel,
Cager and Ell overcome enormous problems, even being hunted by dinosaurs in
the Cretaceous, and Cager falls in love with this indomitable
anthropomorphic copy of a creature from across the galaxy."
