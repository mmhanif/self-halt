**Publisher's Description:**
"SOME STORIES CANNOT BE TOLD IN JUST ONE LIFETIME. Harry August is on his
deathbed. Again. No matter what he does or the decisions he makes, when
death comes, Harry always returns to where he began, a child with all the
knowledge of a life he has already lived a dozen times before. Nothing ever
changes. Until now. As Harry nears the end of his eleventh life, a little
girl appears at his bedside. "I nearly missed you, Doctor August," she
says. "I need to send a message." This is the story of what Harry does
next, and what he did before, and how he tries to save a past he cannot
change and a future he cannot allow."
