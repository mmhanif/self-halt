**Don't Take Yes For An Answer** by Steve Herz

<sup>isbn-13: 9780062869715</sup>

*Audible*

I didn't hold high hopes for this book. I bought it on a whim during one of
Audible's $5 sales and was afraid it would just be another regurgitation of
bland common sense marketed as a new self-improvement breakthrough.

However, I was pleasantly surprised that there was actually some useful takeaways
from this book. The author, Steve Herz, has been an agent and coach for sports,
media and entertainment leaders and brings a slightly different perspective to
self-improvement.

The basic message of the books boils down to the acronym AWE - standing for
**Authority**, **Warmth** and **Energy**.

The author argues that your non-technical skills and Emotional Intelligence (EQ)
is what sets succesful people apart. To build that EQ you need **AWE**:

- **A** stands for Authority — it’s your voice, your body language, your ability
to make eye contact with people. Do you come across as a competent person who
knows how to do this job?
- **W** is for Warmth — it’s the ability to engender trust and make a connection
with another person.
- **E** is for Energy — how are you making other people feel? Are you making
people feel good about you and about themselves, or are you deflating them?


**Publisher's Description:**
"One of the nation's premier talent agents and career advisors shows you how
to catapult your career and your life forward with three key communication
strategies--Authority, Warmth, and Energy. A self-empowerment guide to
achieving your fullest professional and personal potential, Don't Take YES
for An Answer explains why positive feedback limits personal and
professional growth and then teaches you how to embrace hard truths and
critical feedback to escape mediocrity and break away from the pack. To
stand out, to attract the attention of those who can raise your profile, to
protect yourself during lean times, or to gain the interest of future
employers, you must harness three critical communication traits that human
beings respond to most: AWE: A--Authority. W--Warmth. E--Energy. When all
else is equal--education, work ethic, intelligence, experience, ambition--
the single biggest factor in winning business, promotions, friendships, or
followers hinges on our ability to communicate and connect. Mastering AWE
gives you an unparalleled advantage over the competition, no matter your
field. Herz, who has represented and coached dozens of sports, media, and
entertainment leaders over the course of nearly three decades, delivers a
step-by-step program that helps you understand and hone your AWE skills.
Packed with inspiring success stories, grounded in the latest social
psychology and scientific research, and featuring "insider" anecdotes from
some of the most popular entrepreneurs and professionals in broadcasting,
sports, and the corporate world--many personally coached by Herz--Don't
Take YES for An Answer provides invaluable suggestions and practical
techniques for "upping" your AWE in every aspect of your life."
