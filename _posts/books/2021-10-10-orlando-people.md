**Orlando People (Orlando People #1)** by Alexander C. Kane

<sup>ASIN: B07X5MKM8X</sup>

*Audible*

Orlando People (OP) are telekinetics born in Orlando in the 1980s. Some are
super powerful (level 5 - can move multiple heavy objects like cars) while
others are "duds" who can only move a small object a few inches. Gretch Waldegast
is the latter - until she discovers she can also "smell" telekinesis just before
its about to happen. She gets caught up in an FBI murder investigation involving
a rogue OP and an anti-OP movement called "True Hands".

I loved the humor in this and the general premise is well set up and thought
through (i.e. no obvious holes in the explanations of supernatural powers). Also
the narrator (Kristen Sieh) is *really* good.
