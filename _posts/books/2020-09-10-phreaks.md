**Phreaks** by Matthew Derby

<sup>ASIN: B082MP5C8Z</sup>

*Audible*

Short listen from Audible with a full cast including Christian Slater. Set in the
days before the internet, when Ma Bell ruled the phone lines and the proto-hackers
of the day were obsessed with figuring out how to break into the network.

Certainly not an essential listen, but not a waste of time either.
