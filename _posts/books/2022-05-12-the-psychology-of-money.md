**The Psychology Of Money - Timeless Lessons On Wealth, Greed, And Happiness** by Morgan Housel

<sup>isbn-13: 9780857197689</sup>

*Audible*

This felt like a series of essays on how to live, but using money and wealth as a hook. I enjoyed it.

**Publisher's Description:**
"Doing well with money isn’t necessarily about what you know. It’s about how
you behave. And behavior is hard to teach, even to really smart people.
Money—investing, personal finance, and business decisions—is typically
taught as a math-based field, where data and formulas tell us exactly what
to do. But in the real world people don’t make financial decisions on a
spreadsheet. They make them at the dinner table, or in a meeting room,
where personal history, your own unique view of the world, ego, pride,
marketing, and odd incentives are scrambled together. In The Psychology of
Money, award-winning author Morgan Housel shares 19 short stories exploring
the strange ways people think about money and teaches you how to make
better sense of one of life’s most important topics."
