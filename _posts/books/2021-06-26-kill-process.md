**Kill Process** by William Hertling

<sup>isbn-13: 9781942097037</sup>

*Audible*

This is one of the few novels revolving around technology that didn't have me
rolling my eyes at the description of technologies and technical process. The
technical aspects are reasonable to a first and even second order approximation.

The main villain of the novel is a thinly veiled Facebook-Google mix headed by
an evil version of Mark Zuckerberg.

Overall highly recommended thriller for computer and programming geeks.

**Publisher's Description:**
"By day, Angie, a twenty-year veteran of the tech industry, is a data
analyst at Tomo, the world's largest social networking company; by night,
she exploits her database access to profile domestic abusers and kill the
worst of them. She can't change her own traumatic past, but she can save
other women. When Tomo introduces a deceptive new product that preys on
users' fears to drive up its own revenue, Angie sees Tomo for what it
really is--another evil abuser. Using her coding and hacking expertise, she
decides to destroy Tomo by building a new social network that is completely
distributed, compartmentalized, and unstoppable. If she succeeds, it will
be the end of all centralized power in the Internet. But how can an anti-
social, one-armed programmer with too many dark secrets succeed when the
world's largest tech company is out to crush her and a no-name government
black ops agency sets a psychopath to look into her growing digital
footprint?""
