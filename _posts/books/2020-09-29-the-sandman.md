**The Sandman** by Neil Gaiman

<sup>ASIN: B086WP794Z</sup>

*Audible*

A full-cast audiobook adaptation of Neil Gaiman's Sandman comicbooks. The first
half of the book is a single story line following the imprisonment of Morpheus
(the Lord of Dreams) and his subsequent question to restore his power. The remaining
chapters are a series of mostly unconnected vignettes that I found to be a bit
hit or miss.
