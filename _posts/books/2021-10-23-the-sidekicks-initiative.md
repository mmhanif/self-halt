**The Sidekicks Initiative: A Comedy Superhero Adventure** by Barry Hutchinson

<sup>ASIN: B07N6MQZCG</sup>

*Audible*

A fun listen. The premise is a world where superheroes regularly save the planet
from supervillains. They used to have sidekicks with greatly diminished powers
compared to the superheroes, but the sidekicks have gone into retirement and
are living ordinary lives. That is until a new Uber-villain arrives and wipeout
the superheroes - now its up to the sidekicks to save the day.

Its not going to change your life, but still quite enjoyable. In a similar category
to the [Orlando People]({% post_url books/2021-10-10-orlando-people %}) and
[Andrea Vernon]({% post_url books/2018-05-30-andrea-vernon-and-cup %}) series - interesting twists on old
comicbook premises with a heavy dose of sardonic humor.
