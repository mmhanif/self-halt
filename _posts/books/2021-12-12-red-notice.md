**Red Notice** by Bill Browder

<sup>isbn-13: 9781476755717</sup>

*Audible*

This was great book with a very compelling story. It starts out like just another
"how I got rich" story, but evolves into something quite different.

The story details the corruption that blossomed as Russia was reborn from the
ashes of the USSR and then was co-opted by the state under Putin's rule. It reads
like a thriller with many twists and turns. The tenaciousness of Browder is admirable
as he morphs from a financier and businessman to a human-rights activist.

A must-read if you want to understand the corruption at the heart of the modern
Russian state.

**Publisher's Description:**
"Expelled from Russia after exposing corruption in Russian companies, an
investment broker describes how his attorney was detained, tortured and
beaten to death for testifying against Russian law enforcement officers who
stole millions in taxes paid to the government. Illustrations. Tour."
