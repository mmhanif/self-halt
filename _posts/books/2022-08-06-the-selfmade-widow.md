**Publisher's Description:**
"From the cocreator of Deadpool and author of Suburban Dicks comes a
diabolically funny murder mystery that features two unlikely sleuths
investigating a murder that reveals the dark underbelly of suburban
marriage. After mother of five and former FBI profiler Andie Stern solved a
murder—and unraveled a decades-old conspiracy—in her New Jersey town, both
her husband and the West Windsor police hoped that she would set aside
crime-fighting and go back to carpools, changing diapers, and lunches with
her group of mom-friends, who she secretly calls The Cellulitists. Even so,
Andie can’t help but get involved when the husband of Queen Bee Molly Goode
is found dead. Though all signs point to natural causes, Andie begins to
dig into the case and soon risks more than just the clique’s wrath, because
what she discovers might hit shockingly close to home. Meanwhile,
journalist Kenny Lee is enjoying a rehabilitated image after his success as
Andie’s sidekick. But when an anonymous phone call tips him off that Molly
Goode killed her husband, he’s soon drawn back into the thicket of suburban
scandals, uncovering secrets, affairs, and a huge sum of money. Hellbent on
justice and hoping not to kill each other in the process, Andie and Kenny
dust off their suburban sleuthing caps once again."
