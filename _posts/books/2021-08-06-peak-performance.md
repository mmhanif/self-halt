**Publisher's Description:**
"What Makes Great? A few common principles drive performance, regardless of
the field or the task at hand. Whether someone is trying to qualify for the
Olympics, break ground in mathematical theory, or craft an artistic
masterpiece, many of the practices that lead to great success are the same.
In Peak Performance, Brad Stulberg, a former McKinsey and Company
consultant and journalist who covers health and the science of human
performance, and Steve Magness, a performance scientist and coach of world-
class athletes, team up to demystify these practices and demonstrate how
everyone can achieve their best. The first book of its kind, Peak
Performance combines the inspiring stories of top performers across a range
of capabilities—from athletic to intellectual to artistic—with the latest
scientific insights into the cognitive and neurochemical factors that drive
performance in all domains. In doing so, Peak Performance uncovers new
links that hold promise as performance enhancers but that have been
overlooked in our traditional ways of thinking. The result is a life-
changing book in which you will learn how to enhance your performance by
optimally alternating between periods of intense work and rest; priming
your body and mind for enhanced productivity; and developing and harnessing
the power of a self-transcending purpose. In revealing the science of great
performance and the stories of great performers across a wide range of
capabilities, Peak Performance uncovers the secrets of success, and coaches
you on how to use them. If you want to take your game to the next level,
whatever "your game" might be, Peak Performance will teach you how."
