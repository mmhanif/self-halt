**Underground Airlines** by Ben Winters

<sup>isbn-13: 9780316261241</sup>

*Audible*

A book in the "alternative history" genre, which is another genre I like. The premise here is that the American Civil War never happened and slavery is still legal in 4 US states.

**Publisher's Description:**
"It is the present-day, and the world is as we know it: smartphones, social
networking and Happy Meals. Save for one thing: the Civil War never
occurred. A gifted young black man calling himself Victor has struck a
bargain with federal law enforcement, working as a bounty hunter for the US
Marshall Service. He's got plenty of work. In this version of America,
slavery continues in four states called "the Hard Four." On the trail of a
runaway known as Jackdaw, Victor arrives in Indianapolis knowing that
something isn't right--with the case file, with his work, and with the
country itself. A mystery to himself, Victor suppresses his memories of his
childhood on a plantation, and works to infiltrate the local cell of a
abolitionist movement called the Underground Airlines. Tracking Jackdaw
through the back rooms of churches, empty parking garages, hotels, and
medical offices, Victor believes he's hot on the trail. But his strange,
increasingly uncanny pursuit is complicated by a boss who won't reveal the
extraodinary stakes of Jackdaw's case, as well as by a heartbreaking young
woman and her child who may be Victor's salvation. Victor himself may be
the biggest obstacle of all--though his true self remains buried, it
threatens to surface. Victor believes himself to be a good man doing bad
work, unwilling to give up the freedom he has worked so hard to earn. But
in pursuing Jackdaw, Victor discovers secrets at the core of the country's
arrangement with the Hard Four, secrets the government will preserve at any
cost. Underground Airlines is a ground-breaking novel, a wickedly
imaginative thriller, and a story of an America that is more like our own
than we'd like to believe."
