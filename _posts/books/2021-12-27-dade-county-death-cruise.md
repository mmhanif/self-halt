**Dade County Death Cruise (Orlando People #2)** by Alexander C. Kane

<sup>ASIN: B09F1B51GK</sup>

*Audible*

Second in the *Orlando People* series. Orlando People (OP) are telekinetics born
in Orlando in the early 1980s.

It's not high art, but its fun and laugh-out-loud funny at times. Also the
narrator (Kristen Sieh) is incredibly good.
