**The Reluctant Mr. Darwin** by David Quammen

<sup>isbn-13: 9780393059816</sup>

*Audible*

Interesting account of Darwin's life *after* he returned from adventures on the
HMS Beagle. The book details Darwin's struggles to put his ideas and thoughts
into a published book. It also gives an account of the prevailing theories of the
time - I didn't realize that the concept of Evolution predates Darwin, although
it was then called *Transmutation*. The novel idea put forward by Darwin was
*Natural Selection*.

I also didn't realize that Natural Selection took decades to gain widespread
acceptance and it took the rediscovery of Mandel's experiments in genetics to
finally validate Natural Selection.

The book also discusses Alfred Russel Wallace who independently came up with his
own theory of Natural Selection, in part forcing Darwin to publish his theory in
'The Origin of the Species' much earlier than he had planned to.
