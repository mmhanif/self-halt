**A Hero Of Our Time** by Mikhail Lermontov

<sup>isbn-13: 9780140441765</sup>

*Audible*

**Publisher's Description:**
"In its adventurous happenings-its abductions, duels, and sexual
intrigues-"A Hero of Our Time" looks backward to the tales of Sir Walter
Scott and Lord Byron, so beloved by Russian society in the 1820s and '30s.
In the character of its protagonist, Pechorin-the archetypal Russian
antihero-Lermontov's novel looks forward to the subsequent glories of a
Russian literature that it helped, in great measure, to make possible. This
edition includes a Translator's Foreword by Vladimir Nabokov, who
translated the novel in collaboration with his son, Dmitri Nabokov."
