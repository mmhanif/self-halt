**Publisher's Description:**
"“A profound novel about friendship. I loved it to pieces.” —Madeline Miller
“A shining tour de force about a long friendship’s respects, disrespects,
loyalties and moralities.” —Ali Smith From the acclaimed author of Home
Fire, the moving and surprising story of a lifelong friendship and the
forces that bring it to the breaking point Zahra and Maryam have been best
friends since childhood in Karachi, even though—or maybe because—they are
unlike in nearly every way. Yet they never speak of the differences in
their backgrounds or their values, not even after the fateful night when a
moment of adolescent impulse upends their plans for the future. Three
decades later, Zahra and Maryam have grown into powerful women who have
each cut a distinctive path through London. But when two troubling figures
from their past resurface, they must finally confront their bedrock
differences—and find out whether their friendship can survive. Thought-
provoking, compassionate, and full of unexpected turns, Best of Friends
offers a riveting take on an age-old question: Does principle or loyalty
make for the better friend?"
