<sup>isbn-13: 9780692825426</sup>

*Paperback*

**Publisher's Description:**
"Not many people know that Pakistan is home to 108 peaks above 7,000 meters
(22,966 ft.) and many more above 6,000 meters (19,685 ft.). Not only that,
5 out of 14 peaks above 8,000 meters (26,247 ft.) of our planet are in
Pakistan. Trek with me to the remote, rugged, and beautiful mountain range,
Karakoram of Pakistan, where most of these gorgeous peaks stand tall. Know
the ins and outs of the daily drill while you trek all the way to see K2,
the second highest peak in the world, via the Concordia Trek on the Baltoro
Glacier and then return via Gondogoro La and Hushe of the Karakoram range
of Pakistan. Tag along! We will trek more than 85 miles into the thin fresh
air reaching approximately 19,000 feet. Trek and camp on the wild glaciers
with me. We will travel through the concentration of highest peaks of the
world. There are Glaciers so magnificent that they can be seen from space.
This book is your user manual on how to see K2 and come back alive. If
there would be a place in the world where Mountain Gods would live then the
Concordia of the Karakoram would be their throne. This book will humbly
take you to the thrones of the Mountain Gods, Concordia-K2-Gondogoro La of
Pakistan, and bring you back."
