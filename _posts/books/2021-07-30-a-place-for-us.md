**A Place For Us** by Fatima Farheen Mirza

<sup>isbn-13: 9781524763558</sup>

*Audible*

I really enjoyed this book. It resonated with me on many levels, as someone
growing up a Muslim in a "western" environment and also as a parent trying to
raise my children in a Muslim home and pass on Islamic values. But really the
book is about growing up and family and community and belonging - universal themes,
just set in the context of Indian Shia Muslim couple who have created a new life and
raised a family in America.

The both slowly cycles through different narrators, with the reader gaining
additional insight when we see the events through the eyes of a different character.
Particularly poignant for me was the final viewpoint we get from the father, Rafiq,
and how we tries to act with love but almost everything he does is interpeted in
a different way by his son Amar.

Highly recommended.

BuzzFeed “Mirza writes with a mercy that encompasses all things.”—Ron
Charles, Washington Post Hailed as “a book for our times” (Christiane
Amanpour), A Place for Us is a deeply moving and resonant story of love,
identity, and belonging. As an Indian wedding gathers a family back
together, parents Rafiq and Layla must reckon with the choices their
children have made. There is Hadia: their headstrong, eldest daughter,
whose marriage is a match of love and not tradition. Huda, the middle
child, determined to follow in her sister’s footsteps. And lastly, their
estranged son, Amar, who returns to the family fold for the first time in
three years to take his place as brother of the bride. What secrets and
betrayals have caused this close-knit family to fracture? Can Amar find his
way back to the people who know and love him best? A Place for Us takes us
back to the beginning of this family’s life: from the bonds that bring them
together, to the differences that pull them apart. All the joy and struggle
of family life is here, from Rafiq and Layla’s own arrival in America from
India, to the years in which their children—each in their own way—tread
between two cultures, seeking to find their place in the world, as well as
a path home. A Place for Us is a book for our times: an astonishingly
tender-hearted novel of identity and belonging, and a resonant portrait of
what it means to be an American family today. It announces Fatima Farheen
Mirza as a major new literary talent."
