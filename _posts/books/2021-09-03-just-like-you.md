**Just Like You** by Nick Hornby

<sup>isbn-13: 9780593288597</sup>

*Audible*

Like most Nick Hornby novels this one is easily digestible and contains various
insights into the nature of the human character and their relationships. The story
is told through the eyes of a white middle-aged divorcee and a (much) younger
black man. They develop a relationship that both are self-conscious about.
