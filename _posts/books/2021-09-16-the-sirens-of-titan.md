**The Sirens Of Titan** by Kurt Vonnegut

<sup>isbn-13: 9780385333498</sup>

*Audible*

I picked up this novel as a result of some very positive reviews of the book as
a classic of science fiction. This was the first Vonnegut book I've read and I
have to say it left me cold. No likeable characters and a very dated feel, it
left me reluctant to explore Vonnegut any further.

**Publisher's Description:**
"“[Kurt Vonnegut’s] best book . . . He dares not only ask the ultimate
question about the meaning of life, but to answer it.”—Esquire Nominated as
one of America’s best-loved novels by PBS’s The Great American Read The
Sirens of Titan is an outrageous romp through space, time, and morality.
The richest, most depraved man on Earth, Malachi Constant, is offered a
chance to take a space journey to distant worlds with a beautiful woman at
his side. Of course there’ s a catch to the invitation–and a prophetic
vision about the purpose of human life that only Vonnegut has the courage
to tell. “Reading Vonnegut is addictive!”—Commonweal"
