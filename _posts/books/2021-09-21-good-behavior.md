**Good Behavior** by Blake Crouch

<sup>isbn-13: 9781503940499</sup>

*Audible*

Blake Crouch is becoming a favorite author. I really enjoyed [Recursion]({%- post_url books/2019-06-19-recursion -%})
and [Dark Matter]({%- post_url books/2017-02-28-dark-matter -%}). Unlike those
two there is no element of science fiction here, but a still enjoyable ride
alongside ex-thief Letty Dobesh and her adventures.

**Publisher's Description:**
"Three interlocking novellas details the escapades of ex-thief Letty Dobesh
as she uses her skills to stop other crimes from taking place."
