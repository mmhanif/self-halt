**Publisher's Description:**
"One of America's top doctors reveals how AI will empower physicians and
revolutionize patient care Medicine has become inhuman, to disastrous
effect. The doctor-patient relationship--the heart of medicine--is broken:
doctors are too distracted and overwhelmed to truly connect with their
patients, and medical errors and misdiagnoses abound. In Deep Medicine,
leading physician Eric Topol reveals how artificial intelligence can help.
AI has the potential to transform everything doctors do, from notetaking
and medical scans to diagnosis and treatment, greatly cutting down the cost
of medicine and reducing human mortality. By freeing physicians from the
tasks that interfere with human connection, AI will create space for the
real healing that takes place between a doctor who can listen and a patient
who needs to be heard. Innovative, provocative, and hopeful, Deep Medicine
shows us how the awesome power of AI can make medicine better, for all the
humans involved."
