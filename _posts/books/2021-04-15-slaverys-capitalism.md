**Slavery's Capitalism** by Sven Beckert, Seth Rockman

<sup>isbn-13: 9780812248418</sup>

*Audible*

[The Half Has Never Been Told]({%- post_url books/2019-04-08-the-half-has-never-been-told -%})
by Edward Baptist was an eye-opening book about the reality of slavery in America
and how it was the foundation for American economic success in 19th century.

Slavery's Capitalism doesn't provide the same impact, being a collection of essays
about different aspects of the slave trade in the Americas. It does provide some
additional context and detail but some chapters are definitely more compelling
than others.
