**Malfuzat - Volume I** by Hazrat Mirza Ghulam Ahmad

<sup>isbn-13: 9781848803084</sup>

*Hardcover*

The *Malfuzat* are the collected sayings and discourses of Hazrat Mirza Ghulam
Ahmad, founder of the [Ahmadiyya Muslim Community](https://www.alislam.org/library/ahmadiyya-muslim-community/),
and recorded by his companions. Hazrat Mirza Ghulam Ahmad is known by his followers
in the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community as the Promised Messiah and Mahdi.

As the recordings of verbal discourse the language is a little less formal than
the books of the Promised Messiah and thus form an easy to digest introduction
to his teachings.
