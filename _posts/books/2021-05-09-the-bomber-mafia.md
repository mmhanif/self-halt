**The Bomber Mafia** by Malcolm Gladwell

<sup>isbn-13: 9780316296618</sup>

*Audible*

Another enjoyable book from Gladwell. He's the narrator in the Audiobook version
and like his last book [Talking to Strangers]({%- post_url books/2019-10-14-talking-to-strangers -%})
he does a great job. 

A key difference between this book and his previous books is that Gladwell doesn't
have a central thesis that he tries to argue by threading together different stories.
This is more of a linear telling of history, albeit with his usual cast of many
characters.

**Publisher's Description:**
"An exploration of how technology and best intentions collide in the heat of
war In The Bomber Mafia, Malcolm Gladwell weaves together the stories of a
Dutch genius and his homemade computer, a band of brothers in central
Alabama, a British psychopath, and pyromaniacal chemists at Harvard to
examine one of the greatest moral challenges in modern American history.
Most military thinkers in the years leading up to World War II saw the
airplane as an afterthought. But a small band of idealistic strategists had
a different view. This "Bomber Mafia" asked: What if precision bombing
could, just by taking out critical choke points--industrial or
transportation hubs--cripple the enemy and make war far less lethal? In his
podcast, Revisionist History, Gladwell reexamines moments from the past and
asks whether we got it right the first time. In The Bomber Mafia, he steps
back from the bombing of Tokyo on the deadliest night of the war and asks,
"Was it worth it?" The attack was the brainchild of General Curtis LeMay,
whose brutal pragmatism and scorched-earth tactics in Japan cost tens of
thousands of civilian lives, but may have spared more by averting a planned
US invasion. Things might have gone differently had LeMay's predecessor,
General Haywood Hansell, remained in charge. As a key member of the Bomber
Mafia, Hansell believed in precision bombing, but his theories had been
foiled by bad weather, enemy jet fighters, and human error. When he and
Curtis LeMay squared off for a leadership handover in the jungles of Guam,
LeMay emerged victorious, leading to the darkest night of World War II. The
Bomber Mafia is a riveting tale of persistence, innovation, and the
incalculable wages of war."
