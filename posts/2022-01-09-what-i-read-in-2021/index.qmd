I hit my [Goodreads Reading Challenge of 50](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/26167086)
for the first time after a number of years falling short. If you want to, you
can [jump straight to the list of all 50 books here](#fig-y2021).

Here are the best of those 50 books sorted into various categories. Hit the link for each book for some
additional notes and information about each. (Hit the heading link for a
soundtrack while you read, or use the Spotify playlist below).

## [Top of the Pops](https://youtu.be/LWiKV7onnzc)

The three books I read in 2021 that had the strongest emotional impact on me were:
- [Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality](../../books/2021-01-23-harry-potter-and-the-methods-of-rationality): Not a conventional book at all, this was a work of [fan-fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fan_fiction)
that was published entirely online (I downloaded the epub version of it). By far
the longest 'book' I read this year (probably the equivalent of five volumes of
the [actual Harry Potter Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter)).
- [A Place For Us](../../books/2021-07-30-a-place-for-us): An immigrant
story and a coming of age story that affected me strongly.
- [Red Notice](../../books/2021-12-12-red-notice): A whirlwind story of greed and corruption
amongst the oligarchs and officials of post-communist Russia.

## [Change (You Can Change)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0kGo_x12DQ)
I read a few different books on the topic of change. The best was
[Think Again](../../books/2021-12-28-think-again) by Adam Grant.
[How We Change](../../books/2021-07-24-how-we-change) looked at the
subject from a psychotherapists point of view. [Better](../../books/2021-10-08-better)
is about trying to make things better in the medical world.
[Mistakes Were Made (But Not By Me)](../../books/2021-02-04-mistakes-were-made-third-edition)
was updated last year to add a chapter on the Trump phenomenon - a very interesting book
about self-deception, cognitive dissonance and why people don't change their mind even in the
face of clear evidence. I also started [How To Change](https://www.amazon.com/How-Change-Science-Getting-Where-ebook/dp/B08KPFPSNS) but didn't manage to finish it before the end of the year.

## [I Remember That](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7VurhK2kos)
I read quite a few memoirs, especially ones focused on growing up as an
immigrant. My favorite was [Greetings from Bury Park](../../books/2021-09-10-greetings-from-bury-park)
by Sarfraz Manzoor. The others were [No Land's Man](../../books/2021-08-01-no-lands-man),
[Somebody's Daughter](../../books/2021-07-09-somebodys-daughter) and
[Funny in Farsi](../../books/2021-06-21-funny-in-farsi). Also worth
mentioning in this category is [Sophia Of Silicon Valley](../../books/2021-07-13-sophia-of-silicon-valley)
a novel which is in fact a thinly-veiled memoir of the author's time working with
Steve Jobs and Elon Musk.

## [Time After Time](https://youtu.be/fQot1WBA7ng)
I'm always drawn to time-travel books - its probably my favorite science-fiction
sub-genre. [A Gift of Time](../../books/2021-07-04-a-gift-of-time) and
[All Our Wrong Todays](../../books/2021-04-28-all-our-wrong-todays) were
both excellent.

## [Good Technology](https://youtu.be/Cs0OkiCZNRI)
[Kill Process](../../books/2021-06-26-kill-process) is a techno-thriller
that actually gets the technology right.

## [Mad World](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1ZvPSpLxCg)
[The Premonition](../../books/2021-12-23-the-premonition) by Michael
Lewis was a damning indictment of the inaction of the CDC during the Covid-19
pandemic and of the US health system at large.

## [Rome (If You Want To)](https://youtu.be/iNwC0sp-uA4)
Ever since reading Robert Harris' excellent [Cicero Trilogy](https://www.amazon.com/The-Cicero-Trilogy/dp/1786332922)
I have found myself wanting to know more about Roman history. Both
[The Storm Before The Storm](../../books/2021-05-25-the-storm-before-the-storm)
and [SPQR](../../books/2021-06-14-spqr) were accessible entry points to
the broad sweep of Roman politics. I also read [Medicus](../../books/2021-11-06-medicus)
a murder mystery set in Roman Britain which was ... okay.

## [Friends (I'll Be There For You)](https://youtu.be/SCQGnVrTsAM)
A couple of friends and former colleagues published (separately) two excellent
books this year - please go out and buy them:
- [Communication For Engineers](../../books/2021-04-19-communication-for-engineers) by Chris Laffra
- [The Accidental Sexist](../../books/2021-06-03-the-accidental-sexist) by Stephen Koch et al.

## [Its The End Of The World As We Know It (And I Feel Fine)](https://youtu.be/Z0GFRcFm-aY)
Some fun, sometimes funny, novels about superheroes, telekenesis and the metaverse
among other things:
- [The Sidekicks Initiative](../../books/2021-10-23-the-sidekicks-initiative)
- [Orlando People](../../books/2021-10-10-orlando-people) and
[Dade County Death Cruise](../../books/2021-12-27-dade-county-death-cruise)
- [Ready Player One](../../books/2021-05-17-ready-player-one)

## [I Will Follow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sLzV00gNUo)
There are some writers that I read pretty much anything they publish.
[Michael Connelly](https://www.michaelconnelly.com/) is one such author. Nick
Hornby is another writer that can generally be relied upon to produce a readable
novel. Blake Crouch is getting there for me as I work my way through his earlier
works.
- [The Dark Hours](../../books/2021-11-24-the-dark-hours) by Michael Connelly
- [Just Like You](../../books/2021-09-03-just-like-you) by Nick Hornby
- [Good Behavior](../../books/2021-09-21-good-behavior) by Blake Crouch.


## [Don't You (Forget About Me)](https://youtu.be/CdqoNKCCt7A)
Some miscellaneous good reads:
- [Numbers Don't Lie](../../books/2021-10-01-numbers-dont-lie)
- [The Nine Lives Of Pakistan](../../books/2021-02-21-the-nine-lives-of-pakistan)
- [Mythos](../../books/2021-03-18-mythos)
- [The Right It](../../books/2021-05-10-the-right-it)

Overall I read slightly more non-fiction books this year than fiction. I think
this was helped by the number of memoirs I read. Audible was far and away my
input source of choice.
