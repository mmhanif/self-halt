I ended up 2020 having read 34 books - exactly twice [my mid-year mark of 17.](../2020-06-30-what-i-read-in-2020-so-far)
Almost everything I "read" in the second half of 2020 was actually an audiobook,
the only exceptions being [The Holy Quran](../../books/2020-09-20-the-holy-quran-with-arabic-text-and-english-translation) and [Malfuzat](../../books/2020-09-27-malfuzat--volume-i) which were hardcovers.

David Quammen produced probably the most memorable read of the second half of the
year (as he did the first half with [Spillover](../../books/2020-05-20-spillover-animal-infections-and-the-next-human-pandemic)) in [The Reluctant Mr. Darwin](../../books/2020-09-20-the-reluctant-mr-darwin). Not a complete biography of Darwin as it only covers his life after his adventures on the HMS Beagle, but it helps put the theory of evolution in proper historical context. I certainly learn a lot from it.

[The Hate U Give](../../books/2020-07-10-the-hate-u-give) was a timely read given the events of the summer with the Black Lives Matter movement. Although categorized as a "young adult" novel this far-from-young adult found it enjoyable and thought-provoking.

[Orconomics](../../books/2020-10-12-orconomics) and its follow-up [Son Of A Liche](../../books/2020-11-23-son-of-a-liche) were my first forays into [LitRPG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LitRPG). Never having played D&D or its ilk, I wasn't up to speed with all the conventions of the genre - nevertheless I found both books enjoyable and funny. While following the typical fantasy story conventions the books are also an effective satire on capitalism , modern day finance and the housing crash (*Collateralized Threat Obligations* play a big role in the plot of the second book!)

[Storm Front](../../books/2020-12-19-storm-front) was a strong recommendation from a friend - a combination of mystery and magical fantasy. While I enjoyed it, the opportunity costs involved mean I will probably skip investing time into the remaining 16+ novels in the series (at least for now).

On the non-fiction front [Think Like a Rocket Scientist](../../books/2020-08-21-think-like-a-rocket-scientist) and [Workplace Poker](../../books/2020-12-31-workplace-poker) were useful but not essential reads, while [An Economist Walks Into A Brother](../../books/2020-07-19-an-economist-walks-into-a-brothel) was disappointing.
