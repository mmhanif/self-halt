            "content": "I hit my Goodreads Reading Challenge of 50 for the second year in a row. If you want to, you can jump straight to the list of all 50 books here. . . My Favorite Non-Fiction Reads of 2022 . Boyd - The Fighter Pilot Who Changed The Art Of War by Robert Coram: John Boyd is probably up there in list of most influential Americans of the 20th Century that very few people have heard of. A great fighter pilot who then went on to design the F-15 and F-16 fighter aircraft and ended his career as a military theorist whose ideas the US successfully used in both Gulf Wars. Boyd was an iconoclast who continually found himself fighting the Air Force hierarchy. As well as in-depth biography of Boyd, the book also provides an eye-opening inside view of Military-Industrial complex that Eisenhower warned of. Boyd was deeply flawed in many ways but had a personal code of honor that guided him throughout his career. My favorite quote of Boyd’s from the book is: | . “If your boss demands loyalty, give him integrity. But if he demands integrity, then give him loyalty” . Born A Crime - Stories From A South African Childhood by Trevor Noah: This had gotten rave reviews when it first came out, and they were well-deserved. Trevor Noah is a huge success today, but he’s had a remarkable and difficult early life. Along with being his personal story, this is also a story of South Africa during and after the overturning of Apartheid. Noah lets the reader see what it was like growing up poor and black in South Africa but always showing the humanity of the people he came into contact with. . | Freezing Order - A True Story Of Money Laundering, Murder, And Surviving Vladimir Putin’s Wrath by Bill Browder: A follow up to Red Notice this time continuing the story through the American court system. Lots of amazing twists and turn as Browder tussles with Russia in the courts. . | Never Split The Difference - Negotiating As If Your Life Depended On It by Chris Voss: I thought this was going to be one of those “one-idea” books that litters the broad self-help genre, but actually it was both entertaining as well as full of very practical tips. I used some of the tips in a negotiation in 2022 to good effect :-) . | . Honorable Mentions - Non-Fiction . High Conflict - Why We Get Trapped And How We Get Out by Amanda Ripley: I read this as part of my ongoing desire to understand why our society is becoming increasingly polarized and what we can do to understand each other better. A number of good takeaways from this book - for me the primary one was to avoid binary classifications that inevitably become “them and us”. . | Talk Lean - Shorter Meetings. Quicker Results. Better Relations by Alan Palmer: Lot of useful tips in this book about how to use more precise language to get better results. Some of the examples feel very British but I think the advice is universal. . | Lords Of Finance by Liaquat Ahamed: Fascinating account of the period after the First World War where many countries fell into recession and depression and the attempts of key central bankers to try and prevent that from happening but that often made things worse. I feel understand the role of central banks much better after reading this. . | Altitude Or Attitude - A Geeks’s Travel Log; San Francisco To Concordia-K2-Gondogoro La Of Pakistan by Ifti Mirza: This was gifted to me by the author who was a colleague at Meta (although we never met in person). The writing could do with some editing, but the story is an unexpectedly thrilling account of getting to the K2 basecamp and back. I have no particular interest in climbing and I really enjoyed this book, so if you have a passion for climbing I’m sure you’ll love it. It made me realize this particular trip is something I will never want to subject myself to! . | The 6 Types Of Working Genius - A Better Way To Understand Your Gifts, Your Frustrations, And Your Team by Patrick M. Lencioni: I’m a fan of Lencioni’s books and this one provides useful insights into the sorts of things that might provide different people either joy or frustration at work. I used the model from the book with my team at Meta for our second team “summit” (aka offsite in the world of Finance) and found it very helpful. . | Seven Brief Lessons On Physics by Carlo Rovelli: Another slim volume from Carlos Rovelli that packs many interesting facts to ponder on, wrapped up in Rovelli’s at times poetic style of writing. . | The Lion Tracker’s Guide To Life by Boyd Varty: Recommended by a friend who grew up in South Africa and has received personal coaching by Varty. The book provides insights into a whole world that I knew very little about but that we can learn a lot from. . | The Psychology Of Money - Timeless Lessons On Wealth, Greed, And Happiness by Morgan Housel: This felt like a series of essays on how to live, but using money and wealth as a hook. I enjoyed it. . | . Re-reads . The Five Dysfunctions Of A Team - A Leadership Fable, 20th Anniversary Edition by Patrick M. Lencioni: A classic that I assigned to my team at Meta for our first team “summit”. Easy, short read that is valuable for anyone working in a team (which is pretty much everyone). . | Be The Hero - Three Powerful Ways To Overcome Challenges In Work And Life by Noah Blumenthal: Another short and easy read in the “business fable” genre. I re-read this as I had recommended it to my (grown-up) kids to read and I thought I should remind myself about the contents. . | . Fiction . The First Fifteen Lives Of Harry August by Claire North: A variation on the time-travel genre that I’m a sucker for. The premise is that there are people whose life keeps repeating starting from birth but they remember everything they experienced and learnt in previous lives. The chief protagonist, Harry August, is one such person. Well thought out and generally self-consistent - I recommend it if you like the genre. . | Underground Airlines by Ben Winters: A book in the “alternative history” genre, which is another genre I like. The premise here is that the American Civil War never happened and slavery is still legal in 4 US states. . | . All the books I read (or listened to) in 2022: . In roughly chronological order: .

Publisher’s Description: “#1 New York Times Bestseller “ A bold and subversive retelling of the goddess’s story, Circe manages to be both epic and intimate in its scope, recasting the most infamous female figure from the Odyssey as a hero in her own right.” — Alexandra Alter, New York Times In the house of Helios, god of the sun and mightiest of the Titans, a daughter is born. But Circe is a strange child–not powerful, like her father, nor viciously alluring like her mother. Turning to the world of mortals for companionship, she discovers that she does possess power–the power of witchcraft, which can transform rivals into monsters and menace the gods themselves. Threatened, Zeus banishes her to a deserted island, where she hones her occult craft, tames wild beasts and crosses paths with many of the most famous figures in all of mythology, including the Minotaur, Daedalus and his doomed son Icarus, the murderous Medea, and, of course, wily Odysseus. But there is danger, too, for a woman who stands alone, and Circe unwittingly draws the wrath of both men and gods, ultimately finding herself pitted against one of the most terrifying and vengeful of the Olympians. To protect what she loves most, Circe must summon all her strength and choose, once and for all, whether she belongs with the gods she is born from, or the mortals she has come to love. With unforgettably vivid characters, mesmerizing language and page-turning suspense, Circe is a triumph of storytelling, an intoxicating epic of family rivalry, palace intrigue, love and loss, as well as a celebration of indomitable female strength in a man’s world.” .",

The premise here is that the American Civil War never happened and slavery is still legal in 4 US states. . Publisher’s Description: “It is the present-day, and the world is as we know it: smartphones, social networking and Happy Meals. Save for one thing: the Civil War never occurred. A gifted young black man calling himself Victor has struck a bargain with federal law enforcement, working as a bounty hunter for the US Marshall Service. He’s got plenty of work. In this version of America, slavery continues in four states called “the Hard Four.” On the trail of a runaway known as Jackdaw, Victor arrives in Indianapolis knowing that something isn’t right–with the case file, with his work, and with the country itself. A mystery to himself, Victor suppresses his memories of his childhood on a plantation, and works to infiltrate the local cell of a abolitionist movement called the Underground Airlines. Tracking Jackdaw through the back rooms of churches, empty parking garages, hotels, and medical offices, Victor believes he’s hot on the trail. But his strange, increasingly uncanny pursuit is complicated by a boss who won’t reveal the extraodinary stakes of Jackdaw’s case, as well as by a heartbreaking young woman and her child who may be Victor’s salvation. Victor himself may be the biggest obstacle of all–though his true self remains buried, it threatens to surface. Victor believes himself to be a good man doing bad work, unwilling to give up the freedom he has worked so hard to earn. But in pursuing Jackdaw, Victor discovers secrets at the core of the country’s arrangement with the Hard Four, secrets the government will preserve at any cost. Underground Airlines is a ground-breaking novel, a wickedly imaginative thriller, and a story of an America that is more like our own than we’d like to believe.” .",

A year has passed since LAPD detective Renée Ballard quit the force in the face of misogyny, demoralization, and endless red tape. Yet, after the chief of police himself tells her she can write her ticket within the department, Ballard takes back her badge, leaving “the Late Show” to rebuild the cold case unit at the elite Robbery-Homicide Division. For years, Harry Bosch has been working a case that haunts him but that he hasn’t been able to crack–the murder of an entire family by a psychopath who still walks free. Ballard makes Bosch an offer: come work with her as a volunteer investigator in the new Open-Unsolved Unit, and he can pursue his “white whale” with the resources of the LAPD behind him. The two must put aside old resentments to work together again and close in on a dangerous killer.

As one of the first female F-14 Tomcat fighter pilots in the US Navy, as well as a mom, wife, business consultant, Wall Street Journal bestselling author, and global speaker, author Carey Lohrenz knows that the stress we experience can be just as intense as the stress in the cockpit of a fighter jet going Mach 2. But she’s got a secret weapon to prevail: years of training to overcome the specific natures of uncertainty, stress, burnout, anxiety, and pressure. At our core, we know we’ve lost control. We’ve lost our grip on what we really want and who we really want to be. In order to solve the challenges of chaos and make our goals, dreams, and commitments a reality, we have to understand that in order to succeed when the pressure is on and to improve our performance overall, we’ve got to know what we can and cannot control. In Span of Control, Lohrenz walks us through the fundamentals of surviving and succeeding during times of crisis. Weaving together eye-opening science, gripping personal stories, insightful interviews, prescriptive advice, and a high-octane dose of encouragement and practicality, Span of Control helps leaders recognize how to focus on what matters most, formulate a plan for success, and communicate what’s possible.” .",

Publisher’s Description: “NEW YORK TIMES BEST SELLER • The award-winning, best-selling author of Station Eleven and The Glass Hotel returns with a novel of art, time travel, love, and plague that takes the reader from Vancouver Island in 1912 to a dark colony on the moon five hundred years later, unfurling a story of humanity across centuries and space. “One of [Mandel’s] finest novels and one of her most satisfying forays into the arena of speculative fiction yet.” —The New York Times Edwin St. Andrew is eighteen years old when he crosses the Atlantic by steamship, exiled from polite society following an ill-conceived diatribe at a dinner party. He enters the forest, spellbound by the beauty of the Canadian wilderness, and suddenly hears the notes of a violin echoing in an airship terminal—an experience that shocks him to his core. Two centuries later a famous writer named Olive Llewellyn is on a book tour. She’s traveling all over Earth, but her home is the second moon colony, a place of white stone, spired towers, and artificial beauty. Within the text of Olive’s best-selling pandemic novel lies a strange passage: a man plays his violin for change in the echoing corridor of an airship terminal as the trees of a forest rise around him. When Gaspery-Jacques Roberts, a detective in the black-skied Night City, is hired to investigate an anomaly in the North American wilderness, he uncovers a series of lives upended: The exiled son of an earl driven to madness, a writer trapped far from home as a pandemic ravages Earth, and a childhood friend from the Night City who, like Gaspery himself, has glimpsed the chance to do something extraordinary that will disrupt the timeline of the universe. A virtuoso performance that is as human and tender as it is intellectually playful, Sea of Tranquility is a novel of time travel and metaphysics that precisely captures the reality of our current moment.” .",

(All of these words have been added to help this book show up in people’s searches using the wonders of algorithmic technology. Thanks for bearing with us!) NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY NPR • New York Post • Marie Claire • Self • BookRiot Hi! I’m Seth! I was asked to describe my book, Yearbook, for the inside flap (which is a gross phrase) and for websites and shit like that, so… here it goes!!! Yearbook is a collection of true stories that I desperately hope are just funny at worst, and life-changingly amazing at best. (I understand that it’s likely the former, which is a fancy “book” way of saying “the first one.”) I talk about my grandparents, doing stand-up comedy as a teenager, bar mitzvahs, and Jewish summer camp, and tell way more stories about doing drugs than my mother would like. I also talk about some of my adventures in Los Angeles, and surely say things about other famous people that will create a wildly awkward conversation for me at a party one day. I hope you enjoy the book should you buy it, and if you don’t enjoy it, I’m sorry. If you ever see me on the street and explain the situation, I’ll do my best to make it up to you. *I was beaten by Bill O’Reilly, which really sucks.” .",

Publisher’s Description: “A rare, riveting insider’s account on Wall Street—an updated Liar’s Poker—where greed coupled with misogyny and discrimination enforces a culture of exclusion in the upper echelons of Goldman Sachs Jamie Fiore Higgins became one of the few women at the highest ranks of Goldman Sachs. Spurred on by the obligation she felt to her working-class immigrant family, she rose through the ranks and saw it all: out-of-control, lavish parties flowing with never-ending drinks; affairs flouted in the office; rampant drug use; and most pervasively, a discriminatory culture that seemed designed to hold back the few women and people of color employed at the company. Despite Goldman Sachs having the right talking points and statistics, Fiore Higgins soon realized that these provided a veneer to cover up what she found to be an abusive culture. Her account is one filled with shocking stories of harassment and jaw-dropping tales of exclusionary behavior: when she was told she only got promoted because she is a woman; when her coworkers mooed at her after she pumped for her fourth child, defying the superior who had advised her not to breastfeed; or when a male boss used a racial epithet in front of her, other colleagues, and clients without any repercussions. Bully Market sounds the alarm on the culture of finance and corporate America, while offering clear, actionable ideas for creating a fairer workplace. Both a revealing, extraordinary look at the industry and a top Wall Streeter’s explosive personal story, Bully Market is an essential account of one woman’s experience in a flawed system that speaks to the challenge and urgency for change.” .",

I loved it to pieces.” —Madeline Miller “A shining tour de force about a long friendship’s respects, disrespects, loyalties and moralities.” —Ali Smith From the acclaimed author of Home Fire, the moving and surprising story of a lifelong friendship and the forces that bring it to the breaking point Zahra and Maryam have been best friends since childhood in Karachi, even though—or maybe because—they are unlike in nearly every way. Yet they never speak of the differences in their backgrounds or their values, not even after the fateful night when a moment of adolescent impulse upends their plans for the future. Three decades later, Zahra and Maryam have grown into powerful women who have each cut a distinctive path through London. But when two troubling figures from their past resurface, they must finally confront their bedrock differences—and find out whether their friendship can survive. Thought- provoking, compassionate, and full of unexpected turns, Best of Friends offers a riveting take on an age-old question: Does principle or loyalty make for the better friend?” .",

I’m a fan of Lencioni’s books and this one provides useful insights into the sorts of things that might provide different people either joy or frustration at work. I used the model from the book with my team at Meta for our second team “summit” (aka offsite in the world of Finance) and found it very helpful. . Publisher’s Description: “New York Times best-selling author Patrick Lencioni unveils a truly groundbreaking new model that will change the way we think about work and teams forever. The 6 Types of Working Genius is the fastest way to help people identify the type of work that brings them joy and energy, and avoid work that leads to frustration and burnout. Beyond the personal discovery and instant relief that Working Genius provides, the model also gives teams a remarkably simple and practical framework for tapping into one another’s natural gifts, which increases productivity and reduces unnecessary judgment. In classic Lencioni fashion, Pat brings his model to life in a page-turning fable that is as relatable as it is compelling. He tells the story of Bull Brooks, an entrepreneur, husband, and father who sets out to solve his own frustration at work and stumbles into a new way of thinking that changes the way he sees his work, his team, and even his marriage. What sets this book—and the model behind it—apart from other tools and assessments is the speed at which it can be understood and applied, and the relevance it has to every kind of work in life, from running a company to launching a product to managing a family. In addition to this book, Lencioni and the Table Group have created a 10-minute assessment that helps individuals quickly identify their gifts and apply this model to themselves and their teams. Join the hundreds of thousands of people who have already discovered their Working Genius, and experience the transformation in your work, your team, and your life.

Another short and easy read in the “business fable” genre. . Publisher’s Description: “In this engaging parable, author Noah Blumenthal shows that we are all master storytellers. Our stories are vivid, detailed, and convincing. These aren’t the stories we tell around the watercooler or the campfire. They are the stories we tell ourselves—the ones that rattle around in our heads and move us to emotions and actions. If we don’t pay attention, these stories can take us down the victim path—blaming, frustrated, helpless, and hopeless. But at any moment, we have the power to identify and change these stories. We can choose the right stories—the ones that enable us to become “Everyday Heroes.” Be the Hero brings to life the entertaining tale of a struggling young professional who moves from victim to hero by learning to become aware of and change the stories that are holding him back. Battling negativity, inertia, and anger, he learns to see life through a new lens, to create new hero stories that develop his capacity to chart his own course. The powerful resources at the end of the book, including a hero tip of the week, smart cards, manager tip sheets, and more, will help you make your hero stories stick. This simple parable will change your life forever.” .",

Even so, Andie can’t help but get involved when the husband of Queen Bee Molly Goode is found dead. Though all signs point to natural causes, Andie begins to dig into the case and soon risks more than just the clique’s wrath, because what she discovers might hit shockingly close to home. Meanwhile, journalist Kenny Lee is enjoying a rehabilitated image after his success as Andie’s sidekick. But when an anonymous phone call tips him off that Molly Goode killed her husband, he’s soon drawn back into the thicket of suburban scandals, uncovering secrets, affairs, and a huge sum of money.

It is, at heart, a book about creativity—but it is also, as Pixar co-founder and president Ed Catmull writes, “an expression of the ideas that I believe make the best in us possible.” For nearly twenty years, Pixar has dominated the world of animation, producing such beloved films as the Toy Story trilogy, Monsters, Inc., Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Up, WALL-E, and Inside Out, which have gone on to set box-office records and garner thirty Academy Awards. The joyousness of the storytelling, the inventive plots, the emotional authenticity: In some ways, Pixar movies are an object lesson in what creativity really is. Here, in this book, Catmull reveals the ideals and techniques that have made Pixar so widely admired—and so profitable. As a young man, Ed Catmull had a dream: to make the first computer-animated movie. He nurtured that dream as a Ph.D. student at the University of Utah, where many computer science pioneers got their start, and then forged a partnership with George Lucas that led, indirectly, to his co-founding Pixar in 1986. Nine years later, Toy Story was released, changing animation forever. The essential ingredient in that movie’s success—and in the thirteen movies that followed—was the unique environment that Catmull and his colleagues built at Pixar, based on leadership and management philosophies that protect the creative process and defy convention, such as: • Give a good idea to a mediocre team, and they will screw it up. But give a mediocre idea to a great team, and they will either fix it or come up with something better. • If you don’t strive to uncover what is unseen and understand its nature, you will be ill prepared to lead. • It’s not the manager’s job to prevent risks. It’s the manager’s job to make it safe for others to take them. • The cost of preventing errors is often far greater than the cost of fixing them. • A company’s communication structure should not mirror its organizational structure. Everybody should be able to talk to anybody.” .",

            "content": ". Lords Of Finance by Liaquat Ahamed . isbn-13: 9780099493082 . Audible . Fascinating account of the period after the First World War where many countries fell into recession and depression and the attempts of key central bankers to try and prevent that from happening but that often made things worse. I feel understand the role of central banks much better after reading this. . Publisher’s Description: “THIS HAS HAPPENED BEFORE. The current financial crisis has only one parallel: the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and subsequent Great Depression of the 1930s, which crippled the future of an entire generation and set the stage for the horrors of the Second World War. Yet the economic meltdown could have been avoided, had it not been for the decisions taken by a small number of central bankers. In Lords of Finance, we meet these men, the four bankers who truly broke the world: the enigmatic Norman Montagu of the bank of England, Benjamin Strong of the NY Federal Reserve, the arrogant yet brilliant Hjalmar Schacht of the Reichsbanlk and the xenophobic Emile Moreau of the Banque de France. Their names were lost to history, their lives and actions forgotten, until now. Liaquat Ahamed tells their story in vivid and gripping detail, in a timely and arresting reminder that individuals - their ambitions, limitations and human nature - lie at the very heart of global catastrophe.” .",

            "content": ". Seven Brief Lessons On Physics by Carlo Rovelli . isbn-13: 9780141981727 . Paperback Another slim volume from Carlos Rovelli that packs many interesting facts to ponder on, wrapped up in Rovelli’s at times poetic style of writing. . Favorite quotes: . “For now, this is what we know of matter: . A handful of types of elementary particles, which vibrate and fluctuate constantly between existence and non-existence and swarm in space even when it seems that there is nothing there, combine together to infinity like the letters of a cosmic alphabet to tell the immense history of galaxies, of the innumerable stars, of sunlight, of mountains, woods and fields of grain, of the smiling faces of the young at parties, and of the night sky studded with stars.” . page 36 . “Here, in the vanguard, beyond the borders of knowledge, science becomes even more beautiful - incandescent in the forge of nascent ideas, of intuitions, of attempts. Of roads taken and then abandoned, of enthusiasms. In the effort to imagine what has not yet been imagined” . page 38 . “When his great Italian friend Michele Besso died, Einstein wrote a moving letter to Michele’s sister: Michele has left this strange world a little before me. This means nothing. People like us, who believe in physics, know that the distinction made between past, present and future is nothing more than a persistent, stubborn illusion.’” . page 58 . Publisher’s Description: “In this short, playful, entertaining and mind-bending introduction to modern physics, Rovelli explains Einstein’s theory of general relativity, quantum mechanics, black holes, the complex architecture of the universe, elementary particles, gravity, and the nature of the mind. In under one hundred pages, readers will understand the most transformative scientific discoveries of the twentieth century.” .",

            "title": "Should auld acquaintance be forgot...",
            "content": "And no matter how it ends . You should always keep in touch with your friends . “You should always keep in touch with your friends” by The Wedding Present . TL;DR . I sent over 500 Christmas and New Year’s messages last December to people in my LinkedIn network and received over 400 responses. | LinkedIn’s tools didn’t make it easy. | I would have sent more but for a tragic event that sent my reachouts in a different direction. | I had many great responses and overall I felt it was very much worth the effort. | . Backstory . A few days before Christmas last year, I got a LinkedIn message from a former colleague wishing me a happy holiday season. This was not someone I knew particularly well - I had only interacted with him a few times - but I appreciated his reaching out to me. It got me thinking I should do the same to my network and just send a simple season’s greetings message to people who I had not interacted with for a while. . Strong Ties, Weak Ties and No Ties . Now, LinkedIn gets a lot of criticism but the one thing I find it’s good for is keeping in touch with people that you have “weak ties” with, in particular former colleagues. I communicate with close friends (my “strong ties”) by calling or messaging them directly, but I typically don’t want to fill up my address book with contact details of people I worked with twenty years ago. Just trying to keep the details up to date would be a major effort. Instead I rely on LinkedIn to keep us connected. . The problem for me though was that mixed in with those strong and weak ties were a very large amount of “no ties” - people who had asked to be added to my network but never communicated with me again. There were a lot of those, and I wanted to focus on the people in my network that I actually knew. I quickly figured out that trying to work through my network using the LinkedIn website was a waste of time. The sorting and filtering tools are rudimentary and paging through the list of connections was slow and frustrating, especially if you had to start again from the beginning if the page refreshed for some reason. . Instead I used the facility LinkedIn provides to download your data to get a list of my contacts in CSV format. I loaded these into Excel and annotated them into Known, Unknown and Not Sure. . . . Message(s) in a bottle . After this I went about sending an individualized message to each person in the “Known” category, filtering out those who I would typically contact by some means other than LinkedIn. There is no (easy) way to do this programmatically (which is probably a good thing!) so I created a few different template messages - e.g. one for people in the US referencing “Happy Holidays”, one for those in the UK referencing “Merry Christmas and Happy New Year” etc. I then went one by one through my spreadsheet, creating a new message for each person, copying in the template text and customizing it, sending and finally marking that person as contacted on the spreadsheet. . This took some time. Between December 22 and December 27 I sent 538 messages. . Then something happened that took the wind from my sails. . An unexpected and sad event . I did have a morbid thought as I was sending out these messages, especially regarding those I had not been in touch with for many years: “I hope everyone is still alive”. . This background worry became shockingly true on December 28th, when I received an email from a mutual friend that my friend and boss for many years and across multiple companies, Andy Bishop, had passed away unexpectedly in his sleep over Christmas. He was the same age as me (within a few months) and had retired early to spend time with his family in Cornwall, far from the stress of life in London. I could write many pages on what a great guy Andy was and how much he will be missed by all those whom he interacted with. Instead let me direct you to a memorial page created by his colleagues at BP. . At that point I lost my appetite for sending out further season’s greetings and instead decided to leverage my contact list to pass on the sad news to everyone who I knew that had also worked with Andy. We had worked together at JP Morgan, Cygnifi and Bank of America so that list was over 100 people. . Responses . Out of the 538 season’s greetings messages I sent (actually 539 as I did send one more on New Year’s Day) I received responses to 459 of them. 350 of the responses came back within 3 days but I was still getting replies over 3 months later! . . . There were a few kurt “Thanks” responses but many people seemed genuinely happy to get my message and many of their responses put a smile on my face. Only one person (my very first manager at JP Morgan) was curious enough to ask what had prompted me to reach out after so many years. . Some sample responses: . “Wow blast from the past. Wonderful to hear from you. Hope you are well and have a great holidays!” . “Hi Mahmood, it is lovely to hear from you and all the best Xmas wishes to you and your family” . “Thanks Mahmood. Very kind of you to send the message.” . “Wow nice to hear from you! Happy Holidays to you too! 👍👍” . “Thanks for thinking of me, and sending a short note! Happy Holidays to you and your family!” . “Hey - how lovely to hear from you! Best wishes to all Hanifs too!” . “Lovely to hear from you, Mahmood! All is well, thank you, hope the same for you and yours, and that you all have a peaceful Christmas and New Year ahead!” . In conclusion . I found this to be a really worthwhile exercise, one that I hopefully will do again next holidays and one that I recommend to you, despite the effort involved. Life is short and it’s good to renew auld acquaintance. .",

Publisher’s Description: “Co-host of the popular NPR podcast “Planet Money” provides a well- researched, entertaining, somewhat irreverent look at how money is a made- up thing that has evolved over time to suit humanity’s changing needs. What is money anyway, and where and why did it originate? According to Jacob Goldstein, this made-up thing has evolved over centuries and takes different forms based on technological advances, the needs of society, and often the crazy ideas of outliers on the fringes. Told through witty, historical anecdotes, Goldstein demystifies this ever-evolving tool from the invention of the first coins in Mesopotamia, to how China invented paper money centuries before it appeared in the west, how at one point in Sweden men carried giant “coins” on their backs to pay for goods, to the gold standard, pound sterling, origins of the Euro, mutual funds, bitcoin and a cashless society. Money presents entertaining tales of fascinating characters who fundamentally changed our monetary systems such as Genghis Khan, John Law, a convicted murderer and professional gambler, the Luddites, and the anarchist cyberpunks who created bitcoin. Through these major movements we see the rise and fall of various financial institutions: central banks, the stock market, the Federal Reserve, and the shadow institutions like Lehman Brothers that helped create the financial crisis of 2008. Lively and accessible and full of interesting tidbits (the word “banker” comes from the Venetian “bench sitters”-or “banchieri”-of the 1600s who guarded the gold) Goldstein looks at the evolution of money (whose definition appears to be, if we all agree it’s money, then it is money) and confronts its true purpose and who it is supposed to be for.” .",

It’s about how you behave. And behavior is hard to teach, even to really smart people. Money—investing, personal finance, and business decisions—is typically taught as a math-based field, where data and formulas tell us exactly what to do. But in the real world people don’t make financial decisions on a spreadsheet. They make them at the dinner table, or in a meeting room, where personal history, your own unique view of the world, ego, pride, marketing, and odd incentives are scrambled together. In The Psychology of Money, award-winning author Morgan Housel shares 19 short stories exploring the strange ways people think about money and teaches you how to make better sense of one of life’s most important topics.” .",

Publisher’s Description: “This inside story of the rise and fall of WeWork reveals how the excesses of its founder shaped a corporate culture unlike any other. Christened a potential savior of Silicon Valley’s startup culture, Adam Neumann was set to take WeWork, his office share company disrupting the commercial real estate market, public, cash out on the company’s 47 billion dollar valuation, and break the string of major startups unable to deliver to shareholders. But as employees knew, and investors soon found out, WeWork’s capital was built on promises that the company was more than a real estate purveyor, that in fact it was a transformational technology company. Veteran journalist Reeves Weideman dives deep into WeWork and it CEO’s astronomical rise, from the marijuana and tequila-filled board rooms to cult-like company summer camps and consciousness-raising with Anthony Kiedis. Billion Dollar Loser is a character-driven business narrative that captures, through the fascinating psyche of a billionaire founder and his wife and co-founder, the slippery state of global capitalism.” .",

This had gotten rave reviews when it first came out, and they were well-deserved. Trevor Noah is a huge success today, but he’s had a remarkable and difficult early life. Along with being his personal story, this is also a story of South Africa during and after the overturning of Apartheid. Noah lets the reader see what it was like growing up poor and black in South Africa but always showing the humanity of the people he came into contact with. . Publisher’s Description: “#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • More than one million copies sold! A “brilliant” (Lupita Nyong’o, Time), “poignant” (Entertainment Weekly), “soul-nourishing” (USA Today) memoir about coming of age during the twilight of apartheid “Noah’s childhood stories are told with all the hilarity and intellect that characterizes his comedy, while illuminating a dark and brutal period in South Africa’s history that must never be forgotten.”—Esquire Winner of the Thurber Prize for American Humor and an NAACP Image Award • Named one of the best books of the year by The New York Time, USA Today, San Francisco Chronicle, NPR, Esquire, Newsday, and Booklist Trevor Noah’s unlikely path from apartheid South Africa to the desk of The Daily Show began with a criminal act: his birth. Trevor was born to a white Swiss father and a black Xhosa mother at a time when such a union was punishable by five years in prison. Living proof of his parents’ indiscretion, Trevor was kept mostly indoors for the earliest years of his life, bound by the extreme and often absurd measures his mother took to hide him from a government that could, at any moment, steal him away. Finally liberated by the end of South Africa’s tyrannical white rule, Trevor and his mother set forth on a grand adventure, living openly and freely and embracing the opportunities won by a centuries-long struggle. Born a Crime is the story of a mischievous young boy who grows into a restless young man as he struggles to find himself in a world where he was never supposed to exist. It is also the story of that young man’s relationship with his fearless, rebellious, and fervently religious mother—his teammate, a woman determined to save her son from the cycle of poverty, violence, and abuse that would ultimately threaten her own life. The stories collected here are by turns hilarious, dramatic, and deeply affecting. Whether subsisting on caterpillars for dinner during hard times, being thrown from a moving car during an attempted kidnapping, or just trying to survive the life-and-death pitfalls of dating in high school, Trevor illuminates his curious world with an incisive wit and unflinching honesty. His stories weave together to form a moving and searingly funny portrait of a boy making his way through a damaged world in a dangerous time, armed only with a keen sense of humor and a mother’s unconventional, unconditional love.” .",

A small, insignificant company on the edge of bankruptcy had discovered an alchemist’s dream; a miraculous polymer, that when coated on any vehicle, was the equivalent of 30 inches of steel. With bloody conflicts surging in Iraq and Afghanistan, the polymer promises to save thousands of lives and change the course of both wars. Jack Wiley, a successful Wall Street banker, believes he has a found a dream come true when he mysteriously learns of this miraculous polymer. His plan: enlist the help of the Capitol Group, one of the country’s largest and most powerful corporations in a quick, bloodless takeover of the small company that developed the polymer. It seems like a partnership made in heaven…until the Pentagon’s investigative service begins nosing around, and the deal turns into a nightmare.

Publisher’s Description: “For sixty years, Jewish refugees and their descendants have prospered in the Federal District of Sitka, a “temporary” safe haven created in the wake of revelations of the Holocaust and the shocking 1948 collapse of the fledgling state of Israel. Proud, grateful, and longing to be American, the Jews of the Sitka District have created their own little world in the Alaskan panhandle, a vibrant, gritty, soulful, and complex frontier city that moves to the music of Yiddish. For sixty years they have been left alone, neglected and half-forgotten in a backwater of history. Now the District is set to revert to Alaskan control, and their dream is coming to an end: once again the tides of history threaten to sweep them up and carry them off into the unknown. But homicide detective Meyer Landsman of the District Police has enough problems without worrying about the upcoming Reversion. His life is a shambles, his marriage a wreck, his career a disaster. He and his half-Tlingit partner, Berko Shemets, can’t catch a break in any of their outstanding cases. Landsman’s new supervisor is the love of his life—and also his worst nightmare. And in the cheap hotel where he has washed up, someone has just committed a murder—right under Landsman’s nose. Out of habit, obligation, and a mysterious sense that it somehow offers him a shot at redeeming himself, Landsman begins to investigate the killing of his neighbor, a former chess prodigy. But when word comes down from on high that the case is to be dropped immediately, Landsman soon finds himself contending with all the powerful forces of faith, obsession, hopefulness, evil, and salvation that are his heritage—and with the unfinished business of his marriage to Bina Gelbfish, the one person who understands his darkest fears. At once a gripping whodunit, a love story, an homage to 1940s noir, and an exploration of the mysteries of exile and redemption, The Yiddish Policemen’s Union is a novel only Michael Chabon could have written.” .",

            "content": ". Upstream - The Quest To Solve Problems Before They Happen by Dan Heath . isbn-13: 9781982134723 . Audible . Publisher’s Description: “New York Times bestselling author Dan Heath explores how to prevent problems before they happen, drawing on insights from hundreds of interviews with unconventional problem solvers. So often in life, we get stuck in a cycle of response. We put out fires. We deal with emergencies. We stay downstream, handling one problem after another, but we never make our way upstream to fix the systems that caused the problems. Cops chase robbers, doctors treat patients with chronic illnesses, and call-center reps address customer complaints. But many crimes, chronic illnesses, and customer complaints are preventable. So why do our efforts skew so heavily toward reaction rather than prevention? Upstream probes the psychological forces that push us downstream—including “problem blindness,” which can leave us oblivious to serious problems in our midst. And Heath introduces us to the thinkers who have overcome these obstacles and scored massive victories by switching to an upstream mindset. One online travel website prevented twenty million customer service calls every year by making some simple tweaks to its booking system. A major urban school district cut its dropout rate in half after it figured out that it could predict which students would drop out—as early as the ninth grade. A European nation almost eliminated teenage alcohol and drug abuse by deliberately changing the nation’s culture. And one EMS system accelerated the emergency-response time of its ambulances by using data to predict where 911 calls would emerge—and forward-deploying its ambulances to stand by in those areas. Upstream delivers practical solutions for preventing problems rather than reacting to them. How many problems in our lives and in society are we tolerating simply because we’ve forgotten that we can fix them?” .",

Publisher’s Description: “John Boyd was arguably the greatest American military theorist since the sea power strategist Alfred Thayer Mahan at the turn of the 20th Century. Best known for his formulation of the OODA Loop as a model for competitive decision making, Colonel Boyd was also an original thinker in developing tactics for air-to-air combat, designing warplanes, and the fluid, mobile warfare known to the Germans as blitzkrieg and to modern armies as “maneuver warfare.” As much as anyone, John Boyd was the architect of the two great campaigns against Saddam Hussein’s Iraq, both the 1991 liberation of Kuwait and the 2003 “March Up” to Baghdad by the U.S. Army and Marines. But what of the costly, drawn-out insurgency that baffled the invaders once Baghdad had fallen? In this short book, Daniel Ford applies Boyd’s thinking to the problem of counter-insurgency. Unlike the U.S. military in 2003, it turns out that Boyd had indeed put considerable thought into what might transpire after an effective “blitz” campaign. Indeed, he found many similarities between “blitzers” and what he preferred to call guerrillas, and he thought that they might be defeated by turning their own tactics against them. This is an expanded version of a dissertation submitted in the War Studies program at King’s College London.” .",

John Boyd is probably up there in list of most influential Americans of the 20th Century that very few people have heard of. A great fighter pilot who then went on to design the F-15 and F-16 fighter aircraft and ended his career as a military theorist whose ideas the US successfully used in both Gulf Wars. Boyd was an iconoclast who continually found himself fighting the Air Force hierarchy. As well as in-depth biography of Boyd, the book also provides an eye-opening inside view of Military-Industrial complex that Eisenhower warned of. Boyd was deeply flawed in many ways but had a personal code of honor that guided him throughout his career. My favorite quote of Boyd’s from the book is: . “If your boss demands loyalty, give him integrity. But if he demands integrity, then give him loyalty” . There are a small number of Audible books that I like so much that I buy a physical copy of the book. This is one of those books. . Another great quote: . “To be somebody or to do something. In life there is often a roll call. That’s when you will have to make a decision. To be or to do? Which way will you go?” . Publisher’s Description: “John Boyd may be the most remarkable unsung hero in all of American military history. Some remember him as the greatest U.S. fighter pilot ever – the man who, in simulated air-to-air combat, defeated every challenger in less than forty seconds. Some recall him as the father of our country’s most legendary fighter aircraft – the F-15 and F-16. Still others think of Boyd as the most influential military theorist since Sun Tzu. They know only half the story. Boyd, more than any other person, saved fighter aviation from the predations of the Strategic Air Command. His manual of fighter tactics changed the way every air force in the world flies and fights. He discovered a physical theory that forever altered the way fighter planes were designed. Later in life, he developed a theory of military strategy that has been adopted throughout the world and even applied to business models for maximizing efficiency. And in one of the most startling and unknown stories of modern military history, the Air Force fighter pilot taught the U.S. Marine Corps how to fight war on the ground. His ideas led to America’s swift and decisive victory in the Gulf War and foretold the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. On a personal level, Boyd rarely met a general he couldn’t offend. He was loud, abrasive, and profane. A man of daring, ferocious passion and intractable stubbornness, he was that most American of heroes – a rebel who cared not for his reputation or fortune but for his country. He was a true patriot, a man who made a career of challenging the shortsighted and self-serving Pentagon bureaucracy. America owes Boyd and his disciples – the six men known as the “Acolytes” – a great debt. Robert Coram finally brings to light the remarkable story of a man who polarized all who knew him, but who left a legacy that will influence the military – and all of America – for decades to come. ..” .",

Here are the best of those 50 books sorted into various categories. Hit the link for each book for some additional notes and information about each. (Hit the heading link for a soundtrack while you read, or use the Spotify playlist below). . Top of the Pops . The three books I read in 2021 that had the strongest emotional impact on me were: . Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality: Not a conventional book at all, this was a work of fan-fiction that was published entirely online (I downloaded the epub version of it). By far the longest ‘book’ I read this year (probably the equivalent of five volumes of the actual Harry Potter Series). | A Place For Us: An immigrant story and a coming of age story that affected me strongly. | Red Notice: A whirlwind story of greed and corruption amongst the oligarchs and officials of post-communist Russia. | . Change (You Can Change) . I read a few different books on the topic of change. The best was Think Again by Adam Grant. How We Change looked at the subject from a psychotherapists point of view. Better is about trying to make things better in the medical world. Mistakes Were Made (But Not By Me) was updated last year to add a chapter on the Trump phenomenon - a very interesting book about self-deception, cognitive dissonance and why people don’t change their mind even in the face of clear evidence. I also started How To Change but didn’t manage to finish it before the end of the year. . I Remember That . I read quite a few memoirs, especially ones focused on growing up as an immigrant. My favorite was Greetings from Bury Park by Sarfraz Manzoor. The others were No Land’s Man, Somebody’s Daughter and Funny in Farsi. Also worth mentioning in this category is Sophia Of Silicon Valley a novel which is in fact a thinly-veiled memoir of the author’s time working with Steve Jobs and Elon Musk. . Time After Time . I’m always drawn to time-travel books - its probably my favorite science-fiction sub-genre. A Gift of Time and All Our Wrong Todays were both excellent. . Good Technology . Kill Process is a techno-thriller that actually gets the technology right. . Mad World . The Premonition by Michael Lewis was a damning indictment of the inaction of the CDC during the Covid-19 pandemic and of the US health system at large. . Rome (If You Want To) . Ever since reading Robert Harris’ excellent Cicero Trilogy I have found myself wanting to know more about Roman history. Both The Storm Before The Storm and SPQR were accessible entry points to the broad sweep of Roman politics. I also read Medicus a murder mystery set in Roman Britain which was … okay. . Friends (I’ll Be There For You) . A couple of friends and former colleagues published (separately) two excellent books this year - please go out and buy them: . Communication For Engineers by Chris Laffra | The Accidental Sexist by Stephen Koch et al. | . Its The End Of The World As We Know It (And I Feel Fine) . Some fun, sometimes funny, novels about superheroes, telekenesis and the metaverse among other things: . The Sidekicks Initiative | Orlando People and Dade County Death Cruise | Ready Player One | . I Will Follow . There are some writers that I read pretty much anything they publish. Michael Connelly is one such author. Nick Hornby is another writer that can generally be relied upon to produce a readable novel. Blake Crouch is getting there for me as I work my way through his earlier works. . The Dark Hours by Michael Connelly | Just Like You by Nick Hornby | Good Behavior by Blake Crouch. | . Don’t You (Forget About Me) . Some miscellaneous good reads: .

            "content": ". Think Again by Adam Grant . isbn-13: 9781984878106 . Hardcover . For some reason it took me quite a long time to read this book, but overall I’m glad I did. I really enjoyed Adam Grant’s Give and Take and I like his style of writing and exposition. He strikes a nice balance between Gladwell’s journalistic narrative style and a more academic style. . One criticism I had of Give and Take was that it was hard to draw convert into actions for change. This book however ends with 30 actionable tips for rethinking. . This book is about how we change ideas and viewpoints: our own, other people’s and those of organizations and communities collectively. The both has three main parts that organized along those lines: Individual Rethinking, Interpersonal Rethinking Collective Rethinking. . Part I. Individual Rethinking . Here Grant introduces the analogy of the ‘Preacher, Prosecutor, Politician and Scientist’ mindsets. Not surprisingly, he advocates the Scientist mindset as the way to change your beliefs as new evidence is uncovered. . As we thìnk and talk, we often slip into the mindsets of three different professions: preachers, prosecutors, and politicians, In each of these modes, we take on a particular identity and use a distinct set of tools. We go into preacher mode when our sacred beliefs are in jeopardy: we deliver sermons to protect and promote our ideals. We enter prosecutor mode when we recognize flaws in other people’s reasoning: we marshal arguments to prove them wrong and win our case. We shift into politician mode when we’re seeking to win over an audience: we campaign and lobby for the approvall of our constituents. The risk is that we become so wrapped up im preaching that we’re right, prosecuting others who are wrong, and politicking for support that we don’t bother to rethink our own views. . But being a scientist is not just a profession. It’s a frame of mind - a mode of thinking that differs from preaching, prosecuting, and politicking. We move into scientist mode when we’re searching for the truth: we run experiments to test hypotheses and discover knowledge. Scientific tools aren’t reserved for people with white coats and beakers, and using them doesn’t require toiling away for years with a microscope and a petri dish. Hypotheses have as much of a place in our lives as they do in the lab. Experiments can inform our daily decisions. . He also explores confidence, humility, impostor syndrome and finding joy in being wrong. . …feeling like an impostor can make us better learners. Having some doubts about our knowledge and skills takes us off a pedestal, encouraging us to seek out insights from others. As psychologist Elizabeth Krumrei Mancuso and her colleagues write, “Learning requires the humility to realize one has something to learn.” . Part II. Interpersonal Rethinking . The big takeaway for me in this part was the chapter on Motivational Interviewing. . When we’re trying to persuade people, we frequently take an adversarial approach. Instead of opening their minds, we effectively shut them down or rile them up. They play defense by putting up a shield, play offense by preaching their perspectives and prosecuting ours, or play politics by telling us what we want to hear without changing what they actually think. . Motivational interviewing starts with an attitude of humility and curiosity. We don’t know what might motivate someone else to change, but we’re genuinely eager to find out. The goal isn’t to tell people what to do; it’s to help them break out of overconfidence cycles and see new possibilities. Our role is to hold up a mirror so they can see themselves more clearly, and then empower them to examine their beliefs and behaviors. That can activate a rethinking cycle, in which people approach their own views more scientifically. They develop more humility about their knowledge, doubt in their convictions, and curiosity about alternative points of view. . The process of motivational interviewing involves three key techniques: . Asking open-ended questions | Engaging in reflective listening | Affirming the person’s desire and ability to change | . When people ignore advice, it isn’t always because they disagree with it. Sometimes they’re resisting the sense of pressure and the feeling that someone else is controlling their decision. . Psychologists have found that when people detect an attempt at influence, they have sophisticated defense mechanisms. The moment people feel that we’re trying to persuade them, our behavior takes on a different meaning. A straightforward question is seen as a political tactic, a reflective listening statement comes across as a prosecutor’s maneuvering, an affirmation of their ability to change sounds like a preacher’s proselytizing. . Part III. Collective Rethinking . Here Grant discusses ways of depolarizing discussions, teaching students to question knowledge and building cultures of learning at work. . Actions for impact . Top 30 practical takeaways . I. Individual rethinking . A. Develop The Habit of Thinking Again . Think like a scientist. | Define your identity in terms of values, not opinions | See out information that goes against your own views. | B. Calibrate Your Confidence . Beware of getting stranded at the summit of Mount Stupid - don’t confuse confidence with competence. | Harness the benefits of doubt. | Embrace the joy of being wrong. | C. Invite Others to Question Your Thinking . Learn something new from each person you meet. | Build a challenge network, not a support network. | Don’t shy away from constructive conflict. | II. Interpersonal Rethinking . A. Ask Better Questions . Practice the art of persuasive listening - increase your question to statement ratio. | Question how rather than why | Ask “What eveidence would change your mind” | Ask how people originally formed an opinion. | B. Approach Disagreements as Dances, Not Battles . Acknowledge common ground. | Remember that less is often more. | Reinforce freedom of choice. | Have a conversation about the conversation. | III. Collective Rethinking . A. Have More Nuanced Conversations . Complexify contentious topics - look at polarizing issues through the many lenses of a prism. | Don’t shy away from caveats and contingencies. | Expand your emotional range. | B. Teach Kids to Think Again . Have a weekly myth-busting discussion at dinner. | Invite kids to do multiple drafts and seek feedback from others. | Stop asking kids what they want to be when they grow up. | C. Create Learning Organizations . Abandon best practices - continually strive for better practices. | Establish psychological safety. | Keep a rethinking scorecard. | D. Stay Open to Rethinking Your Future . Throw out the ten-year plan. | Rethink your actions, not just your surroundings. | Schedule a life checkup. | Make time to think again. | Publisher’s Description: “#1 New York Times Bestseller “THIS. This is the right book for right now. Yes, learning requires focus. But, unlearning and relearning requires much more—it requires choosing courage over comfort. In Think Again, Adam Grant weaves together research and storytelling to help us build the intellectual and emotional muscle we need to stay curious enough about the world to actually change it. I’ve never felt so hopeful about what I don’t know.” —Brené Brown, Ph.D., #1 New York Times bestselling author of Dare to Lead The bestselling author of Give and Take and Originals examines the critical art of rethinking: learning to question your opinions and open other people’s minds, which can position you for excellence at work and wisdom in life Intelligence is usually seen as the ability to think and learn, but in a rapidly changing world, there’s another set of cognitive skills that might matter more: the ability to rethink and unlearn. In our daily lives, too many of us favor the comfort of conviction over the discomfort of doubt. We listen to opinions that make us feel good, instead of ideas that make us think hard. We see disagreement as a threat to our egos, rather than an opportunity to learn. We surround ourselves with people who agree with our conclusions, when we should be gravitating toward those who challenge our thought process. The result is that our beliefs get brittle long before our bones. We think too much like preachers defending our sacred beliefs, prosecutors proving the other side wrong, and politicians campaigning for approval–and too little like scientists searching for truth. Intelligence is no cure, and it can even be a curse: being good at thinking can make us worse at rethinking. The brighter we are, the blinder to our own limitations we can become. Organizational psychologist Adam Grant is an expert on opening other people’s minds–and our own. As Wharton’s top-rated professor and the bestselling author of Originals and Give and Take, he makes it one of his guiding principles to argue like he’s right but listen like he’s wrong. With bold ideas and rigorous evidence, he investigates how we can embrace the joy of being wrong, bring nuance to charged conversations, and build schools, workplaces, and communities of lifelong learners. You’ll learn how an international debate champion wins arguments, a Black musician persuades white supremacists to abandon hate, a vaccine whisperer convinces concerned parents to immunize their children, and Adam has coaxed Yankees fans to root for the Red Sox. Think Again reveals that we don’t have to believe everything we think or internalize everything we feel. It’s an invitation to let go of views that are no longer serving us well and prize mental flexibility over foolish consistency. If knowledge is power, knowing what we don’t know is wisdom.” .",

Michael Lewis’ book The Big Short was an eye-opening account of the financial crisis of 2008-2009 seen through the eyes of people who saw it coming and were able to profit from it. . His latest book The Premonition is a similar account of those in the US public health sector who saw this epidemic (or at least some viral epidemic) coming, in some cases many years prior. The difference is that nobody ended up profiting from it. Although much blame is rightfully placed on the Trump administration’s lack of interest in public health - they dismantled the pandemic response unit that the George W. Bush administration had created and that the Obama administration maintained - above all, this book is a sweeping indictment of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and their inaction throughout the crisis. . The book points to systemic issues with the way public health is administered in the US and a sort of institutionalized cowardice at the heart of those systems. . Lots of potential heroes do surface in Lewis’ telling of our Pandemic story but a lot of the time they are just not listened to. . Highly recommended. .

This is my third Graham Norton novel after A Keeper and Holding but probably my least favorite of the trio. Perhaps it was because the first two were mysteries of a sort whereas this is more of a family drama. There is a mystery to be revealed here as well, but it’s all reasonably predictable. . Publisher’s Description: “In this “compelling, bighearted, emotionally precise page-turner” (Sunday Times), the New York Times bestselling writer and acclaimed television host explores the aftermath of a tragedy on a small-town to illuminate the shame and longing that can flow through generations–and how the secrets of the heart cannot stay be buried forever. It is 1987 and a small Irish community is preparing for a wedding. The day before the ceremony, a group of young friends, including the bride and groom, are involved in an accident. Three survive. Three are killed. The lives of the families are shattered and the rifts between them ripple throughout the small town. Connor survived, but living among the angry and the mourning is almost as hard as carrying the shame of having been the driver. He leaves the only place he knows for another life, taking his secrets with him. Travelling first to Liverpool, then London, he eventually makes a home–of sorts–for himself in New York, where he finds shelter and the possibility of forging a new life. But the secrets–the unspoken longings and regrets that have come to haunt those left behind–will not be silenced. Before long, Connor will have to confront his past. A powerful and timely novel of emigration and return, Home Stretch demonstrates Norton’s keen understanding of the power of stigma and secrecy–and their devastating effect on ordinary lives.” .",

I bought it on a whim during one of Audible’s $5 sales and was afraid it would just be another regurgitation of bland common sense marketed as a new self-improvement breakthrough. . However, I was pleasantly surprised that there was actually some useful takeaways from this book. The author, Steve Herz, has been an agent and coach for sports, media and entertainment leaders and brings a slightly different perspective to self-improvement. . The basic message of the books boils down to the acronym AWE - standing for Authority, Warmth and Energy. . The author argues that your non-technical skills and Emotional Intelligence (EQ) is what sets succesful people apart. To build that EQ you need AWE: . A stands for Authority — it’s your voice, your body language, your ability to make eye contact with people. Do you come across as a competent person who knows how to do this job? | W is for Warmth — it’s the ability to engender trust and make a connection with another person. | E is for Energy — how are you making other people feel? Are you making people feel good about you and about themselves, or are you deflating them? | . Publisher’s Description: “One of the nation’s premier talent agents and career advisors shows you how to catapult your career and your life forward with three key communication strategies–Authority, Warmth, and Energy. A self-empowerment guide to achieving your fullest professional and personal potential, Don’t Take YES for An Answer explains why positive feedback limits personal and professional growth and then teaches you how to embrace hard truths and critical feedback to escape mediocrity and break away from the pack. To stand out, to attract the attention of those who can raise your profile, to protect yourself during lean times, or to gain the interest of future employers, you must harness three critical communication traits that human beings respond to most: AWE: A–Authority. W–Warmth. E–Energy. When all else is equal–education, work ethic, intelligence, experience, ambition– the single biggest factor in winning business, promotions, friendships, or followers hinges on our ability to communicate and connect. Mastering AWE gives you an unparalleled advantage over the competition, no matter your field. Herz, who has represented and coached dozens of sports, media, and entertainment leaders over the course of nearly three decades, delivers a step-by-step program that helps you understand and hone your AWE skills. Packed with inspiring success stories, grounded in the latest social psychology and scientific research, and featuring “insider” anecdotes from some of the most popular entrepreneurs and professionals in broadcasting, sports, and the corporate world–many personally coached by Herz–Don’t Take YES for An Answer provides invaluable suggestions and practical techniques for “upping” your AWE in every aspect of your life.” .",

The first in a fairly lengthy series with the same main characters. Unfortunately not enough here in the first novel to entice me into continuing with the series. . Publisher’s Description: “Gaius Petrius Ruso is a divorced and down-on his luck army doctor who has made the rash decision to seek his fortune in an inclement outpost of the Roman Empire, namely Britannia. His arrival in Deva (more commonly known as Chester, England) does little to improve his mood, and after a straight thirty six hour shift at the army hospital, he succumbs to a moment of weakness and rescues an injured slave girl, Tilla, from the hands of her abusive owner. Now he has a new problem: a slave who won’t talk and can’t cook, and drags trouble in her wake. Before he knows it, Ruso is caught in the middle of an investigation into the deaths of prostitutes working out of the local bar. A few years earlier, after he rescued Emperor Trajan from an earthquake in Antioch, Ruso seemed headed for glory: now he’s living among heathens in a vermin-infested bachelor pad and must summon all his forensic knowledge to find a killer who may be after him next. Who are the true barbarians, the conquered or the conquerors? It’s up to Ruso—certainly the most likeable sleuth to come out of the Roman Empire—to discover the truth. With a gift for comic timing and historic detail, Ruth Downie has conjured an ancient world as raucous and real as our own.

This book was published just before Covid-19 hit but still has some relevant lessons for us today. It doesn’t just discuss viral contagion, but also financial crises, viral online contents and the spread of ideas. The author is a mathematician and professor of epedemiology. . Overall, an interesting but not essential read. Perhaps would have been a better book to actually read rather than listen to on Audible. . Some takeaways: . Every outbreak is unique. While some outbreaks spread quickly, others ebb off just as fast. | Mathematical models help show the growth of epidemics. | Contagions can affect many industries, including the financial industry. | Contagions can also spread through your social circle. | Gun violence may be a type of behavior that’s socially contagious. | Social behavior online may be different from real life. Abusive “trolling” behavior is common. | Using big data can help with outbreak research but it’s not a panacea. | . Publisher’s Description: “From ad servers to Zika, Ebola to fake news, why the science of infection is the science of modern life In our social-media-laden lives, everyone thinks they understand how things, whether YouTube fads or bank failures, spread: they go viral. In The Rules of Contagion, Adam Kucharski unpacks the science of epidemiology – the movement of diseases – to reveal what is, and isn’t, viral in modern life. Is it true that fake news spreads because it’s an unstoppable mind virus? Actually, brute-force attacks on our attention, not manipulation, explain most of it. Exploring everything from the onset of riots to the power of Instagram influencers, Kucharski shows how hackneyed the popular understanding of virality can be, and how much more compelling the real story is. Whether you are an author seeking an audience, a defender of the truth, or simply someone interested in the science of human social behavior, The Rules of Contagion is essential guide to modern life.” .",

Another book set (at least initially) in a familiar locale, in this case Princeton, the idea of a mathematical thriller was quite interesting but I don’t think the author pulled it off. There doesn’t seem to be anything remarkable or interesting about the logic tree methodology that the story claims provides those who master it almost magical abilities. Just couldn’t see it myself. The writing was a bit patchy, so overall a ‘meh’ rating. . Publisher’s Description: “A Booklife Editor’s Pick “Filled with fascinating characters, breathtaking action… this novel grabs one’s interest from page one.”-Kat Kennedy, The US Review of Books Knowledge is power. It is said that the greatest chess masters can envision a match’s outcome ten moves before it occurs. Imagine a person who can visualize ten steps ahead, not simply in the game of chess, but in every human interaction. Imagine a person who can see a punch before it is thrown; who knows what you are going to say before you say it; who can see every political and economic move long before it happens. Imagine a secret that can make this all possible. Mathematics professor Albert Puddles exposes this secret for himself as he is thrust into a murder investigation on the Princeton campus. The discovery leads Albert to delve into ancient religious interpretation and unmask new analytical abilities, all while teaming up with an aging mentor, a curious teaching assistant, and an elite Book Club on a frantic chase across America to recover this world-changing knowledge before it falls into dangerous hands. Albert-now embedded in a national cat-and-mouse political power play- rediscovers a woman from his past and is forced to confront his own understanding of love, rationality, power, and the true limits of the human mind.” .",

There’s only a thin thread connecting the chapters in this book which are more like a series of vignettes about different aspects of the medical profession. Some chapters are really compelling, some only mildly interesting. There’s no grand theory or overarching narrative though. . Chapter 1: “On Washing Hands” discusses why the discovery by Semmelweis in 1847 that having doctors wash their hands in between deliveries greatly reduced infections took so long to be adopted by the medical community as standard practice. Introduces the concept of positive deviance . Chapter 2: “The Mop Up” shows the difficulties faced by doctors on the front line of polio containment in India. . Chapter 3: “Casualties of War” covers the ongoing improvement in care for soldiers wounded on the battlefield. Chapter 4: “Naked” covers exam room etiquette especially when performing intimate examinations and whether having ‘chaperones’ improves the situation or not. . Chapter 5: “What Doctors Owe” discusses malpractice suits which pits doctors against insurers. . Chapter 6: “Piecework” concerns how much doctors earn and their relationship with the health insurance industry. . Chapter 7: “The Doctors of the Death Chamber” discusses death by lethal injection and the doctors that administer or oversee the procedure and the related ethics. . Chapter 8: “On Fighting” discussed the pros and cons of fighting to treat or save patients when the side-effects can be debilitating or the chances of success are slim. . Chapter 9: “The Score” dives into childbirth and the complications that can arrive. It discusses the invention of the forceps and why it is so rarely used nowadays. The score is a reference to the Apgar Score, a way of ‘measuring’ a child’s chances of survival after birth and the different means that doctors have come up with to improve those chances. . Chapter 10: “The Bell Curve” discusses hospital performance in combatting different diseases and what some hospitals do so that they outperform others. . Chapter 11: “For Performance” highlights difficulties faced by doctors in Indian hospitals where patients often die of treatable causes because of the lack of appropriate instruments. . Afterword: “Suggestions for Becoming a Positive Deviant” - see this summary .

For many years I lived just north-west of Princeton and my daily route to the Princeton Junction train station would take me past 112 Mercer Street, the house where Einstein lived. In fact, I specifically chose that particular routing so that I would drive by Einstein’s house. . The premise of this book is that after World War II Albert Einstein would invite philosopher and (sometime) pacifist, Bertrand Russell, quantum physicist, Wolfgang Pauli and the brilliant logician, Kurt Gödel to his house to discuss science and philosophy. I bought the book under the impression that it would uncover the secrets of what these great men discussed but the reality is that there’s is very little known about these meetings, if indeed the four were ever actually there at the same time. The only written record of these meetings comes from a passing remark in Russell’s Autobiography. Gödel claims to have only ever had one discussion with Russell. . Still it’s a useful hook from which to hang biographies of each man as well as many of their contemporaries (especially Heisenberg and Oppenheimer) and the scientific milieu that each was a part of. It does bounce around a bit from topic to topic, and is not a substitute for a proper biography of each man. .

I’m glad because it was a truly enlightening read. Vaclav Smil uses the numbers and data to reveal a deeper understanding of the state of our world. . There are 71 stories grouped into the following categories: . People: The Inhabitants of Our World | Countries: Nations in the Age of Globalization | Machines, Designs, Devices: Inventions That Made Our Modern World. | Fuels and Electricity: Energizing Our Societies | Transport: How We Get Around | Food: Energizing Ourselves | . There are really no boring stories. Here are some excerpts from a few that were particularly memorable: . How sweating improved hunting . It all comes down to sweating. The two large animals we have mainly used for transport perspire profusely compared to other quadrupeds: in one hour, a horse can lose about 100 grams of water per square meter of skin, and a camel can lose up to 250 g/m². However, a human being can easily shed 500 g/m², enough to remove between 550 and 600 watts’ worth of heat. Peak hourly sweating rates can surpass 2 kilograms per square meter, and the highest reported short-term sweating rate is twice that high. . We are the superstars of sweating, and we need to be. An amateur running the marathon at a slow pace will consume energy at a rate of 700-800 watts, and an experienced marathoner who covers the 42.2 kilometers in 2.5 hours will metabolize at a rate of about 1,300 watts. . How many people did it take to build the Great Pyramid? . People are able to convert about 20 percent of food into useful work, and for hard-working men that energy amounts to about 440 kilojoules a day. . Brexit: Realities that matter most will not change . The country’s old-age dependency ratio (number of people 65 and older as a share of all economically active people 20-64 years of age), standing at 32 percent in 2020 – still slightly lower than in France or Germany - will increase to 47% by the year 2050. No government intervention and no declaration of regained sovereignty and severance from the bureaucrats of Brussels will have any effect on this inexorable process. . Given these fundamental realities, a rational observer must wonder what tangible differences, what clear benefits could any reassertion of British insularity bring. False claims can be painted on buses, extravagant promises are easy to make, feelings of pride or satisfaction may become fleetingly convincing - but none of those intangibles can change what the UK has become: an aging nation; a deindustrialized and worn-out country whose per capita GDP is now just over half of the Irish mean (something that Swift, Gladstone, or Churchill would find utterly unfathomable); another has-been power whose claim to uniqueness rests on having too many troubled princes and on exporting costumed TV series set in fading country mansions staffed with too many servants. . Concerns about Japan’s future . In the long run, the fortunes of nations are determined by population trends. Japan is not only the world’s fastest-aging major economy (already every fourth person is older than 65, and by 2050 that share will be nearly 40 percent), its population is also declining. Today’s 127 million will shrink to 97 million by 2050, and forecasts show shortages of the young labor force needed in construction and healthcare. Who will maintain Japan’s extensive and admirably efficient transportation infrastructures? Who will take care of the millions of old people? By 2050, people above the age of 8o will outnumber the children. . Publisher’s Description: “Vaclav Smil is my favorite author… Numbers Don’t Lie takes everything that makes his writing great and boils it down into an easy-to-read format. I unabashedly recommend this book to anyone who loves learning.”–Bill Gates, GatesNotes An essential guide to understanding how numbers reveal the true state of our world–exploring a wide range of topics including energy, the environment, technology, transportation, and food production. Vaclav Smil’s mission is to make facts matter. An environmental scientist, policy analyst, and a hugely prolific author, he is Bill Gates’ go-to guy for making sense of our world. In Numbers Don’t Lie, Smil answers questions such as: What’s worse for the environment–your car or your phone? How much do the world’s cows weigh (and what does it matter)? And what makes people happy? From data about our societies and populations, through measures of the fuels and foods that energize them, to the impact of transportation and inventions of our modern world–and how all of this affects the planet itself–in Numbers Don’t Lie, Vaclav Smil takes us on a fact-finding adventure, using surprising statistics and illuminating graphs to challenge conventional thinking. Packed with fascinating information and memorable examples, Numbers Don’t Lie reveals how the US is leading a rising worldwide trend in chicken consumption, that vaccination yields the best return on investment, and why electric cars aren’t as great as we think (yet). Urgent and essential, with a mix of science, history, and wit–all in bite-sized chapters on a broad range of topics–Numbers Don’t Lie inspires readers to interrogate what they take to be true.” .",

Andie Stern thought she’d solved her final homicide. Once a budding FBI profiler, she gave up her career to raise her four (soon to be five) children in West Windsor, New Jersey. But one day, between soccer games, recitals, and trips to the local pool, a very pregnant Andie pulls into a gas station–and stumbles across a murder scene.

Like Funny in Farsi much is made of the eccentricities of the author’s father. . I enjoyed reading this and gained a new appreciation for Mandvi but strangely he doesn’t ‘click’ with me. Perhaps the way he and I see the world is just too far out of sync. . Publisher’s Description: ““It always bothered me that Aasif was more than merely funny-he’s also a great actor. Now I’ve learned he’s an amazing storyteller as well, and I am furious . . . but also grateful. Aasif’s movement between cultures and genres is what makes him and his story singularly funny, poignant, and essential.” - John Hodgman, author of The Areas of My Expertise and More Information Than You Require “My father moved our family to the United States because of a word. It was a word whose meaning fascinated him. It was a singularly American word, a fat word, a word that could only be spoken with decadent pride. That word was . . . Brunch! ‘The beauty of America,’ he would say, ‘is they have so much food, that between breakfast and lunch they have to stop and eat again.’” —from “International House of Patel” If you’re an Indo-Muslim-British-American actor who has spent more time in bars than mosques over the past few decades, turns out it’s a little tough to explain who you are or where you are from. In No Land’s Man Aasif Mandvi explores this and other conundrums through stories about his family, ambition, desire, and culture that range from dealing with his brunch-obsessed father, to being a high-school-age Michael Jackson impersonator, to joining a Bible study group in order to seduce a nice Christian girl, to improbably becoming America’s favorite Muslim/Indian/Arab/Brown/Doctor correspondent on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart. This is a book filled with passion, discovery, and humor. Mandvi hilariously and poignantly describes a journey that will resonate with anyone who has had to navigate his or her way in the murky space between lands. Or anyone who really loves brunch.” .",

            "content": ". A Place For Us by Fatima Farheen Mirza . isbn-13: 9781524763558 . Audible . I really enjoyed this book. It resonated with me on many levels, as someone growing up a Muslim in a “western” environment and also as a parent trying to raise my children in a Muslim home and pass on Islamic values. But really the book is about growing up and family and community and belonging - universal themes, just set in the context of Indian Shia Muslim couple who have created a new life and raised a family in America. . The both slowly cycles through different narrators, with the reader gaining additional insight when we see the events through the eyes of a different character. Particularly poignant for me was the final viewpoint we get from the father, Rafiq, and how we tries to act with love but almost everything he does is interpeted in a different way by his son Amar. . Highly recommended. . Publisher’s Description: “AN INSTANT NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • NATIONAL BOOK AWARD “5 UNDER 35” NOMINEE • NEW YORK’S “ONE BOOK, ONE NEW YORK” PICK Named One of the Best Books of the Year: Washington Post • NPR • People • Refinery29 • Parade • BuzzFeed “Mirza writes with a mercy that encompasses all things.”—Ron Charles, Washington Post Hailed as “a book for our times” (Christiane Amanpour), A Place for Us is a deeply moving and resonant story of love, identity, and belonging. As an Indian wedding gathers a family back together, parents Rafiq and Layla must reckon with the choices their children have made. There is Hadia: their headstrong, eldest daughter, whose marriage is a match of love and not tradition. Huda, the middle child, determined to follow in her sister’s footsteps. And lastly, their estranged son, Amar, who returns to the family fold for the first time in three years to take his place as brother of the bride. What secrets and betrayals have caused this close-knit family to fracture? Can Amar find his way back to the people who know and love him best? A Place for Us takes us back to the beginning of this family’s life: from the bonds that bring them together, to the differences that pull them apart. All the joy and struggle of family life is here, from Rafiq and Layla’s own arrival in America from India, to the years in which their children—each in their own way—tread between two cultures, seeking to find their place in the world, as well as a path home. A Place for Us is a book for our times: an astonishingly tender-hearted novel of identity and belonging, and a resonant portrait of what it means to be an American family today. It announces Fatima Farheen Mirza as a major new literary talent.” .",

            "content": ". How We Change by Ross Ellenhorn . isbn-13: 9780062961112 . Audible . Personal change is always a courageous act. . This is ‘change’ from the viewpoint of a psychotherapist and should probably be more accurately titled “why we don’t change”. It focuses mostly on changing negative or toxic behaviors rather changing our thoughts and beliefs. . Ellenhorn claims we are wired to double down on the familiar because of what he calls the “Fear of Hope” - the act of protecting ourselves from further disappointment. . He identifies the “10 Reasons Not to Change” to help us see why we behave the way we do when we are faced with the “challenge of hope”: . Raising one’s own expectations about change: When we change something for the better, we always risk disappointing ourselves if we can’t maintain the change. | Raising the expectations of others: By making a positive change in one’s life, a person not only raises his own expectations; he inevitably raises the expectations of others. Doing so, he risks that others will witness his failure to maintain the new, more positive status he has achieved. | Facing where you are in life: Progressive change requires that individuals assess what they need to change, and thus confront the current state of the lives they have authored. | Taking “small steps”: To change his circumstances, a person is not merely required to face where he is in that moment, but to do so repetitively, as he takes the incremental steps towards a goal. Each step is a reminder of where he is and how far he has to go to reach his goals. | Being accountable for “what’s next”: Each change a person makes testifies that she is accountable for the life that lies ahead. The more she changes, the more the outcome of her life is seen as within her power. | Facing the unknown: By enacting change in one’s life, a person faces the unknown possibilities of a life that is in his hands. When we enact change, we must contend not only with an unpredictable world, but also with the unpredictability of the future created in part by our own actions. | Existential aloneness: Change always makes us face our own aloneness. Enacting change, a person recognizes that she alone is the author of her life, the originator of things she has made happen in the past, what she is making happen now, and what she will make happen in the future. | Losing a social support: When a person makes positive changes in her treatment, she inevitably steps on a path that leads out of treatment, and thus away from prior therapeutic relationships. | Destroying the negatives: Keeping his behavior the same is his only means of protecting an enduring memorial to the past. Changing this behavior is like demolishing his memorial. | Conditional aloneness in the presence of others: Therapists and therapeutic communities offer enduring recognition to those they treat, providing their clients the important sense that they exist in the mind’s eyes of someone else even when they are out of physical sight. And they often provide this continuous attention without the pressures of expectations regarding accountability. | Publisher’s Description: “A paradigm-shifting, instant classic in the making that challenges our assumptions about change by encouraging us to understand and embrace our resistance to it. We all have something we want to change about ourselves. But whether it’s quitting smoking, losing weight, or breaking some common bad habit or negative behavior pattern, we feel a sense of failure when we don’t succeed. This often sets off a cascade of negative feelings and discouragement, making it even harder to change. The voice in our head tells us: Why bother? Successful change depends far more on understanding why we don’t change, psychotherapist and sociologist Ross Ellenhorn insists. His decades-long career as a pioneer in helping people overcome extreme psychiatric experiences and problematic substance use issues– especially those whom the behavioral healthcare system has failed– especially those whom the mental healthcare system has failed–has lead him to develop an effective, long-term method to achieve transformation, from the simplest shifts to the most profound. In How We Change, Ellenhorn looks to the evolutionary imperatives driving us. We are wired to double down on the familiar because of what he calls the Fear of Hope–the act of protecting ourselves from further disappointment. He identifies the “10 Reasons Not to Change” to help us see why we behave the way we do, making it clear that there is nothing broken inside us–it’s how we’re built. By addressing this little known reality, he gives us hope and helps us work toward the change we seek. Ellenhorn speaks to the core of our insecurities and fears about ourselves, with a humor and kindness. By turning our judgements about self-destructive behaviors into curious questions about them, he teaches us to think about our actions to discover what we truly want–even if we’re going about getting it in the wrong way. How We Change is a brilliant approach that will forever alter our perspective–and help us achieve the transformation we truly seek.” .",

This was an enjoyable tale of a young woman’s rise in the world of Silicon Valley technology companies.

Scott Kraft = Steve Jobs | Treehouse = Pixar | Andre Stark = Elon Musk | . Publisher’s Description: “Sharp, dramatic, and full of insider dish, SOPHIA OF SILICON VALLEY is one woman’s story of a career storming the corridors of geek power and living in the shadow of its outrageous cast of maestros. During the heady years of the tech boom, incorrigibly frank Sophia Young lucks into a job that puts her directly in the path of Scott Kraft, the eccentric CEO of Treehouse, a studio whose animated films are transforming movies forever. Overnight, Sophia becomes an unlikely nerd whisperer. Whether her success is due to dumb luck, savage assertiveness, insightful finesse (learned by dealing with her irrational Chinese immigrant mother), or a combination of all three, in her rarified position she finds she can truly shine. As Scott Kraft’s right-hand woman, whip-smart Sophia is in the eye of the storm, sometimes floundering, sometimes nearly losing relationships and her health, but ultimately learning what it means to take charge of her own future the way the men around her do. But when engineer/inventor Andre Stark hires her to run his company’s investor relations, Sophia discovers that the big paycheck and high-status career she’s created for herself may not be worth living in the toxic environment of a boys-club gone bad.” .",

This is not a book I would normally read, but it was assigned reading in a book club I joined in Facebook, so I thought I’d give it a try. I actually got a lot out of reading about the coming of age of a young African-American girl. It certainly gave me insight into points of view and experiences I had not come across before. . Ostensibly the “somebody” of the title is Ford’s father who has been in jail for most of her childhood, but the book really highlights Ford’s troubled relationship with her mother. . I was reminded of Educated by Tara Westover in many way as I was reading this, but Ford’s experiences and troubles are tame compared to Westover’s. This might be unfair, but Ford comes across as a little immature - I wonder if her perspective would change if she herself becomes a mother. . Nevertheless, a worthwhile read. . Publisher’s Description: ““Sure to be one of the best memoirs of 2021.” —Kirkus Reviews, starred review “So clear, sharp, and smooth that the reader sees, in vivid focus, Ford’s complicated childhood, brilliant mind, and golden heart. Ford is a writer for the ages, and Somebody’s Daughter will be a book of the year.” —Glennon Doyle, #1 New York Times bestselling author of Untamed “Ford’s wrenchingly brilliant memoir is truly a classic in the making. The writing is so richly observed and so suffused with love and yearning that I kept forgetting to breathe while reading it.” —John Green, #1 New York Times bestselling author One of the most prominent voices of her generation debuts with an extraordinarily powerful memoir: the story of a childhood defined by the looming absence of her incarcerated father. Through poverty, adolescence, and a fraught relationship with her mother, Ashley Ford wishes she could turn to her father for hope and encouragement. There are just a few problems: he’s in prison, and she doesn’t know what he did to end up there. She doesn’t know how to deal with the incessant worries that keep her up at night, or how to handle the changes in her body that draw unwanted attention from men. In her search for unconditional love, Ashley begins dating a boy her mother hates. When the relationship turns sour, he assaults her. Still reeling from the rape, which she keeps secret from her family, Ashley desperately searches for meaning in the chaos. Then, her grandmother reveals the truth about her father’s incarceration . . . and Ashley’s entire world is turned upside down. Somebody’s Daughter steps into the world of growing up a poor, Black girl in Indiana with a family fragmented by incarceration, exploring how isolating and complex such a childhood can be. As Ashley battles her body and her environment, she embarks on a powerful journey to find the threads between who she is and what she was born into, and the complicated familial love that often binds them.” .",

I’m a sucker for time-travel books and this is one of two great time-travel books I’ve read this year - the other being A Gift of Time. Both of them take some effort to think through (in their own ways) some of the practical questions around time travel - e.g. do your clothes travel with you? what if you materialize into a solid object? etc. . A Gift of Time is the deeper, more broody of the two books. The story spends a good chunk of its time (no pun intended) in 1950’s and 60’s America - these parts of the book reminded me of Stephen King’s brilliant 11/22/63 in its atmospheric evocation of fifties Americana. . The ending was a bit meh, but still a tremendously enjoyable book overall. .

While helping repair the marooned time traveler’s glider, Cager realizes it can return him to his past to correct a mistake that had haunted him his whole life. In gratitude for his help, the virtual creature living in the circuitry of the marooned glider, sends Cager back in time as his ten-year-old self, knowing everything he’d known at eighty. As a bonus, it also gives him access to advanced equations of space and time.But living life over knowing the future isn’t as easy as Cager anticipated, and he bungles his chance at correcting the most serious mistake of his life. Now he must use his new knowledge of advanced math to build his own time machine to go back and try again. Meanwhile Cager’s repairs to the creature’s glider fail, keeping it stranded near earth. In desperation, the whale-like creature sends, Ell, a near-human, female copy containing it’s consciousness to help Cager.

Publisher’s Description: “NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • Finalist for the PEN/USA Award in Creative Nonfiction, the Thurber Prize for American Humor, and the Audie Award in Biography/Memoir This Random House Reader’s Circle edition includes a reading group guide and a conversation between Firoozeh Dumas and Khaled Hosseini, author of The Kite Runner! “Remarkable . . . told with wry humor shorn of sentimentality . . . In the end, what sticks with the reader is an exuberant immigrant embrace of America.”—San Francisco Chronicle In 1972, when she was seven, Firoozeh Dumas and her family moved from Iran to Southern California, arriving with no firsthand knowledge of this country beyond her father’s glowing memories of his graduate school years here. More family soon followed, and the clan has been here ever since. Funny in Farsi chronicles the American journey of Dumas’s wonderfully engaging family: her engineer father, a sweetly quixotic dreamer who first sought riches on Bowling for Dollars and in Las Vegas, and later lost his job during the Iranian revolution; her elegant mother, who never fully mastered English (nor cared to); her uncle, who combated the effects of American fast food with an army of miraculous American weight-loss gadgets; and Firoozeh herself, who as a girl changed her name to Julie, and who encountered a second wave of culture shock when she met and married a Frenchman, becoming part of a one-couple melting pot. In a series of deftly drawn scenes, we watch the family grapple with American English (hot dogs and hush puppies?—a complete mystery), American traditions (Thanksgiving turkey?—an even greater mystery, since it tastes like nothing), and American culture (Firoozeh’s parents laugh uproariously at Bob Hope on television, although they don’t get the jokes even when she translates them into Farsi). Above all, this is an unforgettable story of identity, discovery, and the power of family love. It is a book that will leave us all laughing—without an accent.

Fascinating backstory to the more familiar events surrounding the rise of Julius Caesar and the end of the Republic. After listening to this audiobook it becomes clear that the ‘purity’ of the Roman Republic was always somewhat precarious. . This book introduces characters such as Gaius Marius who was consul an unprecedented seven times and hailed as “the third founder of Rome”, and his nemesis Sulla. We learn of the optimates, supporters of the continued authority of the senate, and populares, those who favoured the cause of the plebeians (the commoners) along with the struggles between the patricians and those considered novus homo (new man). . The main downside of the audiobook version is the difficulty in distinguishing between all the different Gaius and Lucius and Quintus characters. . Publisher’s Description: “The Roman Republic was one of the most remarkable achievements in the history of civilization. After its founding in 509 BCE, Rome grew from an unremarkable Italian city-state to the dominant superpower of the Mediterranean world. Through it all, the Romans never allowed a single man to seize control of the state. Every year for four hundred years the annually elected consuls voluntarily handed power to their successors. Not once did a consul give in to the temptation to grab absolute power and refuse to let it go. It was a run of political self-denial unmatched in the history of the world. The disciplined Roman republicans then proceeded to explode out of Italy and conquer a world filled with petty tyrants, barbarian chieftains, and despotic kings. But the very success of the Republic proved to be its undoing. The republican system was unable to cope with the vast empire Rome ruled. Bankrolled by mountains of imperial wealth and without a foreign enemy to keep them united, ambitious Roman leaders began to stray from the republican austerity of their ancestors. Almost as soon as they had conquered the Mediterranean, Rome would become engulfed in violent political conflicts and civil wars that would destroy the Republic less than a century later. The Storm Before the Storm tells the story of the beginning of the end of the Roman Republic–the story of the first generation that had to cope with the dangerous new political environment made possible by Rome’s unrivaled domination over the known world. The tumultuous years from 133-80 BCE set the stage for the fall of the Republic. The Republic faced issues like rising economic inequality, increasing political polarization, the privatization of the military, endemic social and ethnic prejudice, rampant corruption, ongoing military quagmires, and the ruthless ambition and unwillingness of elites to do anything to reform the system in time to save it–a situation that draws many parallels to present-day America.

            "content": ". The Right It by Alberto Savoia . isbn-13: 9780062884657 . Hardcover . Albert Savoia makes a compelling case for how to improve the odds of your new product succeeding in the marketplace, with a number of practical tips and tools to go along with the theory. . Theory . • The Law of Market Failure: Most new ideas will fail in the market-even if competently executed. . • Most new ideas fail in the market because they are The Wrong It-ideas that the market is not interested in regardless of how well they are executed. . • Your best chance for succeeding in the market is to combine an idea that is The Right It with competent execution. . • You cannot depend on your intuition, other people’s opinions, or other people’s data to determine if a new idea is The Right It. . • The most reliable way to determine if a new idea is likely to be The Right It is to collect Your Own DAta (YODA). . XYZ Hypothesis . At least X% of Y will Z. . X% is a specific percentage of your target market. Y is a clear description of your target market. Z is how you expect the market will engage with your idea. . Hypozooming . The goal of hypozooming is to take a specific but broad hypothesis and zoom in until you have a version of that hypothesis that is actionable and testable right now. It’s a way to go from XYZ to xyz, a smaller, simpler, more immediately verifiable version of your Market Engagement Hypothesis. The idea is that if XYZ is true, then xyz must also be true-but xyz is much easier to test and verify. . Pretotypes . Prototypes and pretotypes serve different functions. Prototypes are primarily designed to test if an idea for a product or service can be built, how it should be built, how (and if) it will work, what’s the best size or shape for it, and so on. . Pretotypes, on the other hand, are designed primarily to validate, quickly and cheaply, if an idea is worth pursuing and building in the first place -a different objective that is best accomplished with a different set of techniques and best served by having its own vocabulary. . TRI Meter . The Right It Meter, TRI Meter for short, is a visual analysis tool to help you interpret the YODA you’ve collected as objectively as possible. More precisely, the TRI Meter is a gauge to help you estimate how likely it is that an idea will succeed in the market, but it’s a gauge that is not too technical, complicated, or confusing - which can easily happen whenever probability and statistics are involved. . Skin-in-the-game Caliper . Assign skin-in-the-game “points” to different types of target market responses. The caliper can be customized for specific products and markets. . Overall process . Start with an idea. . | Identify the Market Engagement Hypothesis. . | Turn the MEH into a say-it-with-numbers XYZ Hypothesis. . | Hypozoom into a set of smaller, easier to test xyx hypotheses. . | Use pretotyping techniques to run experiments and collect YODA. . | Use the TRI Meter with the Skin-in-the-Game Caliper to help you analyze the YODA. . | Decide on the next step: . | a. Go for it! You can’t be 100% sure that your idea is The Right It, but the YODA looks promising enough for you to take a calculated risk. . b. Drop it. As much as you’d like your idea to succeed, the YODA stubbornly indicates otherwise. . c. Tweak it. In the process of testing your idea, you have learned invaluable things about your target market and its willingness (or unwillingness) to engage with your product. Don’t hesitate to tweak your original idea (or your hypotheses) to reflect what you’ve learned along the way. You may find that although there is not enough market interest in your original idea, there may be great interest in something related to it. Or try flipping the idea on its head and see what you come up with. . Publisher’s Description: “The Law of Market Failure: Most new products will fail in the market, even if competently executed. Using his experience at Google, his remarkable success as an entrepreneur and consultant, and insights from his lectures at Stanford University and Google, Alberto Savoia’s The Right It offers an unparalleled approach to beating the beast that is market failure. Millions of people around the world are working hard to bring to life new ideas. Some of these ideas will turn out to be stunning successes that will have a major impact on our world and our culture: The next Google, the next Polio vaccine, the next Harry Potter, the next Red Cross, the next Ford Mustang. Others will be smaller, more personal but no less meaningful, successes: A little restaurant that becomes a neighborhood favorite, a biography that does not make the best-seller list but tells an important story, a local nonprofit to care for abandoned pets. At this very same moment, another group of people is working equally hard to develop new ideas that, when launched, will fail. Some of them will fail spectacularly and publicly: like New Coke, the movie “John Carter”, or the Ford Edsel. Others will be smaller, more private, but no less painful failures: A home-based business that never takes off, a children’s book that neither publishers nor children have any interest in, a charity for a cause that too few people care enough about. If you are currently working to develop a new idea, whether on your own or as part of a team, which group are you in? Most people believe that they either are, or will be, in the first group—the group whose ideas will be successful. All they have to do is work hard and execute well. Unfortunately, we know that this cannot be the case. The law of market failure tells us that up to 90 percent of most new products, services, businesses, and initiatives will fail soon after they are launched—regardless of how promising they sound, how much we commit to them, or how well we execute them. This is a hard fact to accept. We believe that other people fail because they don’t know what they are doing. Somehow, we believe that this does not apply to us and to our idea—especially if we’ve experienced victories in the past. Filled with detailed case studies, a lesson on creating your own hard data, a strategy for market engagement, and an introduction to the concept of a pretotype (not a prototype), The Right It is a groundbreaking, entertaining, and highly practical book delivers a proven formula for turning ideas, products, services, and businesses into successful endeavors. As Alberto writes, “make sure you are building The Right It before you build It right”.” .",

            "content": ". The Bomber Mafia by Malcolm Gladwell . isbn-13: 9780316296618 . Audible . Another enjoyable book from Gladwell. He’s the narrator in the Audiobook version and like his last book Talking to Strangers he does a great job. . A key difference between this book and his previous books is that Gladwell doesn’t have a central thesis that he tries to argue by threading together different stories. This is more of a linear telling of history, albeit with his usual cast of many characters. . Publisher’s Description: “An exploration of how technology and best intentions collide in the heat of war In The Bomber Mafia, Malcolm Gladwell weaves together the stories of a Dutch genius and his homemade computer, a band of brothers in central Alabama, a British psychopath, and pyromaniacal chemists at Harvard to examine one of the greatest moral challenges in modern American history. Most military thinkers in the years leading up to World War II saw the airplane as an afterthought. But a small band of idealistic strategists had a different view. This “Bomber Mafia” asked: What if precision bombing could, just by taking out critical choke points–industrial or transportation hubs–cripple the enemy and make war far less lethal? In his podcast, Revisionist History, Gladwell reexamines moments from the past and asks whether we got it right the first time. In The Bomber Mafia, he steps back from the bombing of Tokyo on the deadliest night of the war and asks, “Was it worth it?” The attack was the brainchild of General Curtis LeMay, whose brutal pragmatism and scorched-earth tactics in Japan cost tens of thousands of civilian lives, but may have spared more by averting a planned US invasion. Things might have gone differently had LeMay’s predecessor, General Haywood Hansell, remained in charge. As a key member of the Bomber Mafia, Hansell believed in precision bombing, but his theories had been foiled by bad weather, enemy jet fighters, and human error. When he and Curtis LeMay squared off for a leadership handover in the jungles of Guam, LeMay emerged victorious, leading to the darkest night of World War II. The Bomber Mafia is a riveting tale of persistence, innovation, and the incalculable wages of war.” .",

            "content": ". All Our Wrong Todays by Elan Mastai . isbn-13: 9781101985137 . Audible . I’m a sucker for time-travel books and this is one of two great time-travel books I’ve read this year - the other being A Gift of Time. Both of them take some effort to think through (in their own ways) some of the practical questions around time travel - e.g. do your clothes travel with you? what if you materialize into a solid object? etc. . All Our Wrong Todays is the jokier of the two, but has its more profound moments too. I was particularly intrigued by the author’s reference to French philosopher Paul Virilio’s idea of the “integral accident”. . A quote from the book: . Cat’s Cradle is about a lot of things, but a major plot thread involves the invention of ice-nine, a substance that freezes everything it touches, which falls out of its creator’s control and destroys all life on the planet. . Lionel Goettreider read Cat’s Cradle and had a crucial realization, what he called the “Accident”— when you invent a new technology, you also invent the accident of that technology. . When you invent the car, you also invent the car accident. When you invent the plane, you also invent the plane crash. When you invent nuclear fission, you also invent the nuclear meltdown. When you invent ice-nine, you also invent unintentionally freezing the planet solid. . When Lionel Goettreider invented the Goettreider Engine, he knew he couldn’t turn it on until he figured out its accident—and how to prevent it. . Publisher’s Description: “There’s no such thing as the life you’re “supposed” to have… You know the future that people in the 1950s imagined we’d have? Well, it happened. In Tom Barren’s 2016, humanity thrives in a techno-utopian paradise of flying cars, moving sidewalks, and moon bases, where avocados never go bad and punk rock never existed . . . because it wasn’t necessary. Except Tom just can’t seem to find his place in this dazzling, idealistic world, and that’s before his life gets turned upside down. Utterly blindsided by an accident of fate, Tom makes a rash decision that drastically changes not only his own life but the very fabric of the universe itself. In a time-travel mishap, Tom finds himself stranded in our 2016, what we think of as the real world. For Tom, our normal reality seems like a dystopian wasteland. But when he discovers wonderfully unexpected versions of his family, his career, and–maybe, just maybe–his soul mate, Tom has a decision to make. Does he fix the flow of history, bringing his utopian universe back into existence, or does he try to forge a new life in our messy, unpredictable reality? Tom’s search for the answer takes him across countries, continents, and timelines in a quest to figure out, finally, who he really is and what his future–our future–is supposed to be. All Our Wrong Todays is about the versions of ourselves that we shed and grow into over time. It is a story of friendship and family, of unexpected journeys and alternate paths, and of love in its multitude of forms. Filled with humor and heart, and saturated with insight and intelligence and a mind-bending talent for invention, this novel signals the arrival of a major talent.” .",

This is a great introductory book on communication skills for developers, especially those early in their careers or developers whose career has hit a plateau and they’re not sure why. I’ve given away a copy to every developer on the teams I supported over the last year. Chris is a former colleague from our Bank of America days on the Quartz team, and I can attest to Chris being a great communicator. . As Chris explains in his book, only a relatively small fraction of a developer’s impact (say 30% as a rule of thumb) is down to their technical capabilities - a much larger fraction is down to how well they communicate with others. I say “introductory” because the book covers a lot of ground and aims for breadth rather than depth. In many ways the book is a field guide to all the non-technical aspects of what software developer does. Although it introduces a host of theories and mental models, this is a very practical book with a host of actionable tips in each chapter of what to do or not to do. . Despite being most useful for early career developers, even more seasoned professionals can gain valuable tips and insights from the book. This is a self-published book, so don’t expect the polish of say an O’Reilly book and the numerous links that Chris provides work better on the kindle version than the hardcopy version. .",

Publisher’s Description: “The bestselling author of Bringing Down the House (sixty-three weeks on the New York Times bestseller list and the basis for the hit movie 21) and The Accidental Billionaires (the basis for the Academy Award–winning film The Social Network) delivers an epic drama of wealth, rivalry, and betrayal among mega-wealthy Russian oligarchs—and its international repercussions. Once Upon a Time in Russia is the untold true story of the larger-than-life billionaire oligarchs who surfed the waves of privatization to reap riches after the fall of the Soviet regime: “Godfather of the Kremlin” Boris Berezovsky, a former mathematician whose first entrepreneurial venture was running an automobile reselling business, and Roman Abramovich, his dashing young protégé who built a multi-billion-dollar empire of oil and aluminum. Locked in a complex, uniquely Russian partnership, Berezovsky and Abramovich battled their way through the “Wild East” of Russia with Berezovsky acting as the younger man’s krysha—literally, his roof, his protector. Written with the heart-stopping pacing of a thriller—but even more compelling because it is true—this story of amassing obscene wealth and power depicts a rarefied world seldom seen up close. Under Berezovsky’s krysha, Abramovich built one of Russia’s largest oil companies from the ground up and in exchange made cash deliveries—including 491 million dollars in just one year. But their relationship frayed when Berezovsky attacked President Vladimir Putin in the media—and had to flee to the UK. Abramovich continued to prosper. Dead bodies trailed Berezovsky’s footsteps, and threats followed him to London, where an associate of his died painfully and famously of Polonium poisoning. Then Berezovsky himself was later found dead, declared a suicide. Exclusively sourced, capturing a momentous period in recent world history, Once Upon a Time in Russia is at once personal and political, offering an unprecedented look into the wealth, corruption, and power behind what Graydon Carter called “the story of our age.”” .",

On assignment for the New York Times and other outlets, Walsh traveled from the raucous port of Karachi to the salons of Lahore, and from Baluchistan to the mountains of Waziristan. He met a diverse cast of extraordinary Pakistanis–a chieftain readying for war at his desert fort, a retired spy skulking through the borderlands, and a crusading lawyer risking death for her beliefs, among others. Unbeknownst to Walsh, an intelligence agent was tracking him. Written in the aftermath of Walsh’s dramatic deportation, The Nine Lives of Pakistan concludes with an astonishing encounter with that agent, and his revelations about Pakistan’s powerful security state. Intimate and complex, attuned to the centrifugal forces of history, identity, and faith, The Nine Lives of Pakistan offers an unflinching account of life in a precarious, vital country.” .",

            "content": ". Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality by Less Wrong (aka Eliezer Yudkowsky) . HPMOR website . E-Book . I really enjoyed this e-book. I was reading about Bayes Rule and stumbled across the essay An Intuitive Explanation of Bayes’ Theorem. From there I found the LessWrong website which had a link intriguingly entitled The Methods of Rationality. After a little more research I found the hpmor.com website and downloaded an epub version of the book. . The premise of the book is an alternate Harry Potter reality where rather than being raised by a cruel and ignorant aunt and uncle, instead a highly educated aunt and uncle train him in the scientific method and they emphasize a highly rational approach to the world. When Harry is introduced to the world of magic it shakes his fundamental assumptions about how the universe works. Nevertheless, he sets out to understand this strange new world of magic using rational thinking and scientific methods. . This is a huge book with a word count of 661,619 - for reference, the total word count in JK Rowling’s Harry Potter series is 1,084,170. I personally found the quality of the writing and plot to be very high, with many genuinely exciting scenes. If you are a dyed-in-the-wool Harry Potter fan, be prepared for many of your character assumptions to be challenged or overturned. And if you’re a Ron Weasley fan, then don’t bother with this book. . There are certain viewpoints that the author, Eliezer Yudkowsky , asserts through the novel that I disagree with - in particular, the notion of death being the main enemy to overcome. Somehow, that seems a somewhat unjustifiable stand from a rational perspective. . Overall, if you are science nerd but still enjoyed the original Harry Potter series, I think you’ll love this alternate version. .",

            "content": "I ended up 2020 having read 34 books - exactly twice my mid-year mark of 17. Almost everything I “read” in the second half of 2020 was actually an audiobook, the only exceptions being The Holy Quran and Malfuzat which were hardcovers. . David Quammen produced probably the most memorable read of the second half of the year (as he did the first half with Spillover) in The Reluctant Mr. Darwin. Not a complete biography of Darwin as it only covers his life after his adventures on the HMS Beagle, but it helps put the theory of evolution in proper historical context. I certainly learn a lot from it. . The Hate U Give was a timely read given the events of the summer with the Black Lives Matter movement. Although categorized as a “young adult” novel this far-from-young adult found it enjoyable and thought-provoking. . Orconomics and its follow-up Son Of A Liche were my first forays into LitRPG. Never having played D&amp;D or its ilk, I wasn’t up to speed with all the conventions of the genre - nevertheless I found both books enjoyable and funny. While following the typical fantasy story conventions the books are also an effective satire on capitalism , modern day finance and the housing crash (Collateralized Threat Obligations play a big role in the plot of the second book!) . Storm Front was a strong recommendation from a friend - a combination of mystery and magical fantasy. While I enjoyed it, the opportunity costs involved mean I will probably skip investing time into the remaining 16+ novels in the series (at least for now). . On the non-fiction front Think Like a Rocket Scientist and Workplace Poker were useful but not essential reads, while An Economist Walks Into A Brother was disappointing. .

But when a local kid whose brother has gone missing arm-twists him into investigating, Cal uncovers layers of darkness beneath his picturesque retreat, and starts to realize that even small towns shelter dangerous secrets. “One of the greatest crime novelists writing today” (Vox) weaves a masterful, atmospheric tale of suspense, asking what we sacrifice in our search for truth and justice, and what we risk if we don’t.” .",

Of course, that’s a terrible arrangement for the Shadowkin; Orcs, Goblins, Kobolds, and their ilk must apply for to become Noncombatant Paper Carriers (or NPCs) to avoid being killed and looted by heroes.When Gorm Ingerson, a Dwarven ex-hero with a checkered past, stands up for an undocumented Goblin, he inadvertently singles himself out for recruitment by a prophet of the mad goddess to undertake a suicidal quest. But there’s more to Gorm’s new job than an insane prophecy: powerful corporations and governments have shown an unusual interest in the quest. If his party of eccentric misfits can stop fighting each other long enough to recover the Elven Marbles, Gorm might be able to turn a bad deal into a golden opportunity.” .",

As a Muslim from birth, I have, of course, read the Holy Quran multiple times. In adult life I try and read a few lines every day - in Arabic and English. During the month of Ramadhan, Muslims try and read the whole Quran (in Arabic). I have never quite managed to do, given the constraints of work and commuting, as well as the difficulty of reading the Arabic for a non-Arabic speaker. This year, working from home due to being in lockdown and not having to commute to work, I was able to get pretty close - I got through about 27 of the 30 parts of the Quran. (I finished the rest off in the weeks that followed.) Every day, I would read the Arabic for one “part” and then the English translation. . Reading the whole Quran this way from front to back (rather than dipping in and out) gives you a better sense of the broader themes in the Quran. You read various portions of the story of Biblical prophets such Adam, Noah, Abraham, Joseph, Moses, David and Solomon interweaved with each other. There are non-Biblical stories giving the example of the peoples of Ad and Thamud and the prophet Saleh. The story of Mary and Jesus is also mentioned in numerous places in the Quran. . Other than a chapter dedicated to the story of Joseph, the Quran never gives a complete narrative in one place - instead it uses the examples of different prophets in different places to make a point. . Obviously I have some degree of bias, being a Muslim, but I do recommend non-Muslims to read the Quran with a good translation (such as this one). Although it shares many of the characters that are in the Bible, the overall feel and flow of the Quran is very different. .

Publisher’s Description: “Named a “must read” by Susan Cain, “endlessly fascinating” by Daniel Pink, and “bursting with practical insights” by Adam Grant. A former rocket scientist reveals the habits, ideas, and strategies that will empower you to turn the seemingly impossible into the possible. Rocket science is often celebrated as the ultimate triumph of technology. But it’s not. Rather, it’s the apex of a certain thought process – a way to imagine the unimaginable and solve the unsolvable. It’s the same thought process that enabled Neil Armstrong to take his giant leap for mankind, that allows spacecraft to travel millions of miles through outer space and land on a precise spot, and that brings us closer to colonizing other planets. Fortunately, you don’t have to be a rocket scientist to think like one. In this accessible and practical book, Ozan Varol reveals nine simple strategies from rocket science that you can use to make your own giant leaps in work and life – whether it’s landing your dream job, accelerating your business, learning a new skill, or creating the next breakthrough product. Today, thinking like a rocket scientist is a necessity. We all encounter complex and unfamiliar problems in our lives. Those who can tackle these problems – without clear guidelines and with the clock ticking – enjoy an extraordinary advantage. Think Like a Rocket Scientist will inspire you to take your own moonshot and enable you to achieve liftoff.” .",

            "content": ". An Economist Walks Into A Brothel by Allison Schrager . isbn-13: 9780525533962 . Audible . Publisher’s Description: “Is it worth swimming in shark-infested waters to surf a 50-foot, career- record wave? Is it riskier to make an action movie or a horror movie? Should sex workers forfeit 50 percent of their income for added security or take a chance and keep the extra money? Most people wouldn’t expect an economist to have an answer to these questions–or to other questions of daily life, such as who to date or how early to leave for the airport. But those people haven’t met Allison Schrager, an economist and award-winning journalist who has spent her career examining how people manage risk in their lives and careers. Whether we realize it or not, we all take risks large and small every day. Even the most cautious among us cannot opt out– the question is always which risks to take, not whether to take them at all. What most of us don’t know is how to measure those risks and maximize the chances of getting what we want out of life. In An Economist Walks into a Brothel, Schrager equips readers with five principles for dealing with risk, principles used by some of the world’s most interesting risk takers. For instance, she interviews a professional poker player about how to stay rational when the stakes are high, a paparazzo in Manhattan about how to spot different kinds of risk, horse breeders in Kentucky about how to diversify risk and minimize losses, and a war general who led troops in Iraq about how to prepare for what we don’t see coming. When you start to look at risky decisions through Schrager’s new framework, you can increase the upside to any situation and better mitigate the downsides.” .",

The roughly 3 hours a day I spent commuting was my reading time. I would typically read non-fiction during the morning commute when my brain was sharp and able to absorb new ideas. On the way home, I would escape to fiction. I still haven’t been able to replace that commute time with at-home reading time on a regular basis. There always seems to be something slightly more pressing to do at home than sitting down and reading a book. . In any case, my standout book so far in 2020 has been Spillover - Animal Infections And The Next Human Pandemic by David Quammen. Essential reading for a Covid-19 world. . The Art of Statistics - How To Learn From Data by David Spiegelhalter was an entertaining and educational tour through the world of statistics. .

Publisher’s Description: “The legendary advertising guru—Ogilvy UK’s vice chairman—and star of three massively popular TED Talks, blends the science of human behavior with his vast experience in the art of persuasion in this incomparable book that decodes successful branding and marketing in the vein of Freakonomics, Thinking Fast and Slow, and The Power of Habit. When Rory Sutherland was a trainee working on a direct mail campaign at the famed advertising firm OgilvyOne, he noticed that very small changes in design often had immense effects on the number of consumer responses. Yet no one he worked with knew why. Sutherland began taking stock of each effective yet nebulous trick—”the thing which has no name”—he discovered. As he rose in the advertising industry, he began to understand why these things had no name: no one was interested in quantifying them, cataloguing them, or really investigating them. So, he did it himself. Like classic behavioral economists Daniel Kahneman and Richard Thaler, Sutherland peels away hidden, often irrational human behaviors that explain how the world around us functions. In How to Be an Alchemist he examines why certain ads work and the broader truths they tell us about who we are. Why do people prefer stripy toothpaste, and how might that help us design retirement plans that young people would actually buy? Why do we think orange juice is healthy, and how does the same principle guide our feelings about nuclear reactors? Why do budget airlines advertise services they don’t offer—and what might insurance companies learn from them about keeping healthcare costs low? Filled with startling and profound conclusions, Sutherland’s journey through the world of advertising and its surprising lessons for human behavior is insightful, brilliant, eye-opening, and irresistibly fun.” .",

Publisher’s Description: “The hero of The Poet and The Scarecrow is back in the new thriller from #1 New York Times bestselling author Michael Connelly. Jack McEvoy, the journalist who never backs down, tracks a serial killer who has been operating completely under the radar–until now. Veteran reporter Jack McEvoy has taken down killers before, but when a woman he had a one-night stand with is murdered in a particularly brutal way, McEvoy realizes he might be facing a criminal mind unlike any he’s ever encountered. McEvoy investigates—against the warnings of the police and his own editor—and makes a shocking discovery that connects the crime to other mysterious deaths across the country. But his inquiry hits a snag when he himself becomes a suspect. As he races to clear his name, McEvoy’s findings point to a serial killer working under the radar of law enforcement for years, and using personal data shared by the victims themselves to select and hunt his targets. Called “the Raymond Chandler of this generation” (Associated Press), Michael Connelly once again delivers an unputdownable thriller that reveals a predator operating from the darkest corners of human nature—and one man courageous and determined enough to stand in his way.” .",

Through the young eyes of Scout and Jem Finch, Harper Lee explores with rich humor and unswerving honesty the irrationality of adult attitudes toward race and class in the Deep South of the 1930s. The conscience of a town steeped in prejudice, violence, and hypocrisy is pricked by the stamina and quiet heroism of one man’s struggle for justice—but the weight of history will only tolerate so much. One of the best-loved classics of all time, To Kill a Mockingbird has earned many distinctions since its original publication in 1960. It has won the Pulitzer Prize, been translated into more than forty languages, sold more than forty million copies worldwide, and been made into an enormously popular movie. It was also named the best novel of the twentieth century by librarians across the country (Library Journal). “ .",

In this controversial and exciting listen, Pollan explores caffeine’s power as the most-used drug in the world—and the only one we give to children (in soda pop) as a treat. . Pollan takes us on a journey through the history of the drug, which was first discovered in a small part of East Africa and within a century became an addiction affecting most of the human species. Caffeine, it turns out, has changed the course of human history—won and lost wars, changed politics, dominated economies. What’s more, the author shows that the Industrial Revolution would have been impossible without it. The science of how the drug has evolved to addict us is no less fascinating.

Publisher’s Description: “Ebola, SARS, Hendra, AIDS, and countless other deadly viruses all have one thing in common: the bugs that transmit these diseases all originate in wild animals and pass to humans by a process called spillover. In this gripping account, David Quammen takes the reader along on this astonishing quest to learn how, where from, and why these diseases emerge and asks the terrifying question: What might the next big one be?” . Quotes . Any such spillover in the reverse direction—from humans to a nonhuman species—is known as an anthroponosis. The famous mountain gorillas, for instance, have been threatened by anthroponotic infections such as measles, carried by ecotourists who come to dote upon them. . . With influenza and many other diseases the order is reversed, high infectivity preceding symptoms by a matter of days. A perverse pattern: the danger, then the warning. That probably helped account for the scale of worldwide misery and death during the 1918–1919 influenza: high infectivity among cases before they experienced the most obvious and debilitating stages of illness. The bug traveled ahead of the sense of alarm. And that infamous global pandemic, remember, occurred in the era before globalization. Everything nowadays moves around the planet faster, including viruses. . . The much darker story remains to be told, probably not about this virus but about another. When the Next Big One comes, we can guess, it will likely conform to the same perverse pattern, high infectivity preceding notable symptoms. That will help it to move through cities and airports like an angel of death. . . That’s the salubrious thing about zoonotic diseases: They remind us, as St. Francis did, that we humans are inseparable from the natural world. In fact, there is no “natural world,” it’s a bad and artificial phrase. There is only the world. Humankind is part of that world, as are the ebolaviruses, as are the influenzas and the HIVs, as are Nipah and Hendra and SARS, as are chimpanzees and bats and palm civets and bar-headed geese, as is the next murderous virus—the one we haven’t yet detected. . . individual effort, individual discernment, individual choice can have huge effects in averting the catastrophes that might otherwise sweep through a herd. . .",

Publisher’s Description: “Shay was still angry but shrugged nonchalantly as if to say, it’s not that big of a deal. “So, what am I wrong about?” “You’re not going to want to hear this, but I have to tell you anyway.” Liam paused before finishing. “You might be working hard, but you’re not doing it for the company.” “What the hell does that mean?” Shay wanted to know. Knowing that his adversary might punch him for what he was about to say, Liam responded. “You’re doing it for yourself.” New York Times best-selling author Patrick Lencioni has written a dozen books that focus on how leaders can build teams and lead organizations. In The Motive, he shifts his attention toward helping them understand the importance of why they’re leading in the first place. In what may be his edgiest page-turner to date, Lencioni thrusts his readers into a day-long conversation between rival CEOs. Shay Davis is the CEO of Golden Gate Alarm, who, after just a year in his role, is beginning to worry about his job and is desperate to figure out how to turn things around. With nowhere else to turn, Shay receives some hard-to-swallow advice from the most unlikely and unwanted source—Liam Alcott, CEO of a more successful security company and his most hated opponent. Lencioni uses unexpected plot twists and crisp dialogue to take us on a journey that culminates in a resolution that is as unexpected as it is enlightening. As he does in his other books, he then provides a straightforward summary of the lessons from the fable, combining a clear explanation of his theory with practical advice to help executives examine their true motivation for leading. In addition to provoking readers to honestly assess themselves, Lencioni presents action steps for changing their approach in five key areas. In doing so, he helps leaders avoid the pitfalls that stifle their organizations and even hurt the people they are meant to serve.” .",

Publisher’s Description: “The vast amounts of ontologically unstructured information on the Web, including HTML, XML and JSON documents, natural language documents, tweets, blogs, markups, and even structured documents like CSV tables, all contain useful knowledge that can present a tremendous advantage to the Artificial Intelligence community if extracted robustly, efficiently and semi- automatically as knowledge graphs. Domain-specific Knowledge Graph Construction (KGC) is an active research area that has recently witnessed impressive advances due to machine learning techniques like deep neural networks and word embeddings. This book will synthesize Knowledge Graph Construction over Web Data in an engaging and accessible manner. The book will describe a timely topic for both early -and mid-career researchers. Every year, more papers continue to be published on knowledge graph construction, especially for difficult Web domains. This work would serve as a useful reference, as well as an accessible but rigorous overview of this body of work. The book will present interdisciplinary connections when possible to engage researchers looking for new ideas or synergies. This will allow the book to be marketed in multiple venues and conferences. The book will also appeal to practitioners in industry and data scientists since it will have chapters on both data collection, as well as a chapter on querying and off-the-shelf implementations. The author has, and continues to, present on this topic at large and important conferences. He plans to make the powerpoint he presents available as a supplement to the work. This will draw a natural audience for the book. Some of the reviewers are unsure about his position in the community but that seems to be more a function of his age rather than his relative expertise. I agree with some of the reviewers that the title is a little complicated. I would recommend “Domain Specific Knowledge Graphs”.” .",

Publisher’s Description: “Shares counterintuitive advice on the most effective path to success in any domain while revealing the essential contributions of generalist, not specialist, team members” . Quotes . Eventual elites typically devote less time early on to deliberate practice in the activity in which they will eventually become experts. Instead, they undergo what researchers call a “sampling period.” They play a variety of sports, usually in an unstructured or lightly structured environment; they gain a range of physical proficiencies from which they can draw; they learn about their own abilities and proclivities; and only later do they focus in and ramp up technical practice in one area. . . I dove into work showing that highly credentialed experts can become so narrow-minded that they actually get worse with experience, even while becoming more confident—a dangerous combination. And I was stunned when cognitive psychologists I spoke with led me to an enormous and too often ignored body of work demonstrating that learning itself is best done slowly to accumulate lasting knowledge, even when that means performing poorly on tests of immediate progress. That is, the most effective learning looks inefficient; it looks like falling behind. . . increasing specialization has created a “system of parallel trenches” in the quest for innovation. Everyone is digging deeper into their own trench and rarely standing up to look in the next trench over, even though the solution to their problem happens to reside there. . . The challenge we all face is how to maintain the benefits of breadth, diverse experience, interdisciplinary thinking, and delayed concentration in a world that increasingly incentivizes, even demands, hyperspecialization. . . The bestseller Talent Is Overrated used the Polgar sisters and Tiger Woods as proof that a head start in deliberate practice is the key to success in “virtually any activity that matters to you.” The powerful lesson is that anything in the world can be conquered in the same way. It relies on one very important, and very unspoken, assumption: that chess and golf are representative examples of all the activities that matter to you. . . It was a wide-ranging review of research that rocked psychology because it showed experience simply did not create skill in a wide range of real-world scenarios, from college administrators assessing student potential to psychiatrists predicting patient performance to human resources professionals deciding who will succeed in job training. In those domains, which involved human behavior and where patterns did not clearly repeat, repetition did not cause learning. Chess, golf, and firefighting are exceptions, not the rule. . . In 2009, Kahneman and Klein took the unusual step of coauthoring a paper in which they laid out their views and sought common ground. And they found it. Whether or not experience inevitably led to expertise, they agreed, depended entirely on the domain in question. Narrow experience made for better chess and poker players and firefighters, but not for better predictors of financial or political trends, or of how employees or patients would perform. . . The domains Klein studied, in which instinctive pattern recognition worked powerfully, are what psychologist Robin Hogarth termed “kind” learning environments. Patterns repeat over and over, and feedback is extremely accurate and usually very rapid. In golf or chess, a ball or piece is moved according to rules and within defined boundaries, a consequence is quickly apparent, and similar challenges occur repeatedly. . . Kahneman was focused on the flip side of kind learning environments; Hogarth called them “wicked.” In wicked domains, the rules of the game are often unclear or incomplete, there may or may not be repetitive patterns and they may not be obvious, and feedback is often delayed, inaccurate, or both. . . Our greatest strength is the exact opposite of narrow specialization. It is the ability to integrate broadly. . . “AI systems are like savants.” They need stable structures and narrow worlds. . . When narrow specialization is combined with an unkind domain, the human tendency to rely on experience of familiar patterns can backfire horribly—like the expert firefighters who suddenly make poor choices when faced with a fire in an unfamiliar structure. . . All this is bad news for some of the business world’s favorite successful-learning analogies—the Polgars, Tiger, and to some degree analogies based in any sport or game. Compared to golf, a sport like tennis is much more dynamic, with players adjusting to opponents every second, to surfaces, and sometimes to their own teammates. (Federer was a 2008 Olympic gold medalist in doubles.) But tennis is still very much on the kind end of the spectrum compared to, say, a hospital emergency room, where doctors and nurses do not automatically find out what happens to a patient after their encounter. They have to find ways to learn beyond practice, and to assimilate lessons that might even contradict their direct experience. The world is not golf, and most of it isn’t even tennis. As Robin Hogarth put it, much of the world is “Martian tennis.” You can see the players on a court with balls and rackets, but nobody has shared the rules. It is up to you to derive them, and they are subject to change without notice. . . The main conclusion of work that took years of studying scientists and engineers, all of whom were regarded by peers as true technical experts, was that those who did not make a creative contribution to their field lacked aesthetic interests outside their narrow area. As psychologist and prominent creativity researcher Dean Keith Simonton observed, “rather than obsessively focus[ing] on a narrow topic,” creative achievers tend to have broad interests. “This breadth often supports insights that cannot be attributed to domain-specific expertise alone.” . . Connolly’s primary finding was that early in their careers, those who later made successful transitions had broader training and kept multiple “career streams” open even as they pursued a primary specialty. They “traveled on an eight-lane highway,” he wrote, rather than down a single-lane one-way street. They had range. The successful adapters were excellent at taking knowledge from one pursuit and applying it creatively to another, and at avoiding cognitive entrenchment. They employed what Hogarth called a “circuit breaker.” They drew on outside experiences and analogies to interrupt their inclination toward a previous solution that may no longer work. Their skill was in avoiding the same old patterns. In the wicked world, with ill-defined challenges and few rigid rules, range can be a life hack. . . In Flynn’s terms, we now see the world through “scientific spectacles.” He means that rather than relying on our own direct experiences, we make sense of reality through classification schemes, using layers of abstract concepts to understand how pieces of information relate to one another. . . Research on thousands of adults in six industrializing nations found that exposure to modern work with self-directed problem solving and nonrepetitive challenges was correlated with being “cognitively flexible.” . . that modern life requires range, making connections across far-flung domains and ideas. Luria addressed this kind of “categorical” thinking, which Flynn would later style as scientific spectacles. “[It] is usually quite flexible,” Luria wrote. “Subjects readily shift from one attribute to another and construct suitable categories. They classify objects by substance (animals, flowers, tools), materials (wood, metal, glass), size (large, small), and color (light, dark), or other property. The ability to move freely, to shift from one category to another, is one of the chief characteristics of ‘abstract thinking.’” . . Chicago has long prided itself on a core curriculum dedicated to interdisciplinary critical thinking. The two-year core, according to the university, “is intended as an introduction to the tools of inquiry used in every discipline—science, mathematics, humanities, and social sciences. The goal is not just to transfer knowledge, but to raise fundamental questions and to become familiar with the powerful ideas that shape our society.” . . Jeannette Wing, a computer science professor at Columbia University and former corporate vice president of Microsoft Research, has pushed broad “computational thinking” as the mental Swiss Army knife. She advocated that it become as fundamental as reading, even for those who will have nothing to do with computer science or programming. “Computational thinking is using abstraction and decomposition when attacking a large complex task,” she wrote. “It is choosing an appropriate representation for a problem.” . . Like chess masters and firefighters, premodern villagers relied on things being the same tomorrow as they were yesterday. They were extremely well prepared for what they had experienced before, and extremely poorly equipped for everything else. Their very thinking was highly specialized in a manner that the modern world has been telling us is increasingly obsolete. They were perfectly capable of learning from experience, but failed at learning without experience. And that is what a rapidly changing, wicked world demands—conceptual reasoning skills that can connect new ideas and work across contexts. Faced with any problem they had not directly experienced before, the remote villagers were completely lost. That is not an option for us. The more constrained and repetitive a challenge, the more likely it will be automated, while great rewards will accrue to those who can take conceptual knowledge from one problem or domain and apply it in an entirely new one. . . The psychologists highlighted the variety of paths to excellence, but the most common was a sampling period, often lightly structured with some lessons and a breadth of instruments and activities, followed only later by a narrowing of focus, increased structure, and an explosion of practice volume. . . But for learning that is both durable (it sticks) and flexible (it can be applied broadly), fast and easy is precisely the problem. . . Kornell was explaining the concept of “desirable difficulties,” obstacles that make learning more challenging, slower, and more frustrating in the short term, but better in the long term. . . Used for learning, testing, including self-testing, is a very desirable difficulty. Even testing prior to studying works, at the point when wrong answers are assured. . . another important desirable difficulty: “spacing,” or distributed practice. It is what it sounds like—leaving time between practice sessions for the same material. You might call it deliberate not-practicing between bouts of deliberate practice. . . In 2007, the U.S. Department of Education published a report by six scientists and an accomplished teacher who were asked to identify learning strategies that truly have scientific backing. Spacing, testing, and using making-connections questions were on the extremely short list. All three impair performance in the short term. . . Psychologist Robert Bjork first used the phrase “desirable difficulties” in 1994. Twenty years later, he and a coauthor concluded a book chapter on applying the science of learning like this: “Above all, the most basic message is that teachers and students must avoid interpreting current performance as learning. Good performance on a test during the learning process can indicate mastery, but learners and teachers need to be aware that such performance will often index, instead, fast but fleeting progress.” . . for knowledge to be flexible, it should be learned under varied conditions, an approach called varied or mixed practice, or, to researchers, “interleaving.” Interleaving has been shown to improve inductive reasoning. When presented with different examples mixed together, students learn to create abstract generalizations that allow them to apply what they learned to material they have never encountered before. . . Desirable difficulties like testing and spacing make knowledge stick. It becomes durable. Desirable difficulties like making connections and interleaving make knowledge flexible, useful for problems that never appeared in training. All slow down learning and make performance suffer, in the short term. . . Before-our-eyes progress reinforces our instinct to do more of the same, but just like the case of the typhoid doctor, the feedback teaches the wrong lesson. Learning deeply means learning slowly. The cult of the head start fails the learners it seeks to serve. Knowledge with enduring utility must be very flexible, composed of mental schemes that can be matched to new problems. . . When a knowledge structure is so flexible that it can be applied effectively even in new domains or extremely novel situations, it is called “far transfer.” . . “In my opinion,” Gentner told me, “our ability to think relationally is one of the reasons we’re running the planet. Relations are really hard for other species.” Analogical thinking takes the new and makes it familiar, or takes the familiar and puts it in a new light, and allows humans to reason through problems they have never seen in unfamiliar contexts. It also allows us to understand that which we cannot see at all. . . In a wicked world, relying upon experience from a single domain is not only limiting, it can be disastrous. . . The trouble with using no more than a single analogy, particularly one from a very similar situation, is that it does not help battle the natural impulse to employ the “inside view,” a term coined by psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky. We take the inside view when we make judgments based narrowly on the details of a particular project that are right in front of us. . . Our natural inclination to take the inside view can be defeated by following analogies to the “outside view.” The outside view probes for deep structural similarities to the current problem in different ones. The outside view is deeply counterintuitive because it requires a decision maker to ignore unique surface features of the current project, on which they are the expert, and instead look outside for structurally similar analogies. It requires a mindset switch from narrow to broad. . . Psychologists have shown repeatedly that the more internal details an individual can be made to consider, the more extreme their judgment becomes. . . In one of the most cited studies of expert problem solving ever conducted, an interdisciplinary team of scientists came to a pretty simple conclusion: successful problem solvers are more able to determine the deep structure of a problem before they proceed to match a strategy to it. Less successful problem solvers are more like most students in the Ambiguous Sorting Task: they mentally classify problems only by superficial, overtly stated features, like the domain context. For the best performers, they wrote, problem solving “begins with the typing of the problem.” As education pioneer John Dewey put it in Logic, The Theory of Inquiry, “a problem well put is half-solved.” . . In the late 1960s, future Nobel laureate economist Theodore Schultz argued that his field had done well to show that higher education increased worker productivity, but that economists had neglected the role of education in allowing individuals to delay specialization while sampling and finding out who they are and where they fit. . . Learning stuff was less important than learning about oneself. Exploration is not just a whimsical luxury of education; it is a central benefit. . . The expression “young and foolish,” he wrote, describes the tendency of young adults to gravitate to risky jobs, but it is not foolish at all. It is ideal. They have less experience than older workers, and so the first avenues they should try are those with high risk and reward, and that have high informational value. . .",

            "content": ". The Art Of Statistics by David Spiegelhalter . isbn-13: 9781541618510 . Hardcover . Publisher’s Description: “The definitive guide to statistical thinking Statistics are everywhere, as integral to science as they are to business, and in the popular media hundreds of times a day. In this age of big data, a basic grasp of statistical literacy is more important than ever if we want to separate the fact from the fiction, the ostentatious embellishments from the raw evidence – and even more so if we hope to participate in the future, rather than being simple bystanders. In The Art of Statistics, world- renowned statistician David Spiegelhalter shows readers how to derive knowledge from raw data by focusing on the concepts and connections behind the math. Drawing on real world examples to introduce complex issues, he shows us how statistics can help us determine the luckiest passenger on the Titanic, whether a notorious serial killer could have been caught earlier, and if screening for ovarian cancer is beneficial. The Art of Statistics not only shows us how mathematicians have used statistical science to solve these problems – it teaches us how we too can think like statisticians. We learn how to clarify our questions, assumptions, and expectations when approaching a problem, and – perhaps even more importantly – we learn how to responsibly interpret the answers we receive. Combining the incomparable insight of an expert with the playful enthusiasm of an aficionado, The Art of Statistics is the definitive guide to stats that every modern person needs.” . Notes . . Epistemic Uncertainty . epistemic uncertainty: lack of knowledge about facts, numbers or scientific hypotheses. . Aleatory Uncertainty . aleatory uncertainty: unavoidable unpredictability about the future, also known as chance, randomness, luck and so on. . P18 . Introduction . Turning experiences into data is not straightforward, and data is inevitably limited in its capacity to describe the world. . Statistical science has a long and successful history, but is now changing in the light of increased availability of data. . Skill in statistical methods plays an important part of being a data scientist. . Teaching statistics is changing from a focus on mathematical methods to one based on an entire problem-solving cycle. . The PPDAC cycle provides a convenient framework: Problem - Plan - Data - Analysis – Conclusion and communication. . Data literacy is a key skill for the modern world. . P38 . Getting Things In Proportion . Binary variables are yes/no questions, sets of which can be summarized as proportions. . Positive or negative framing of proportions can change their emotional impact. . Relative risks tend to convey an exaggerated importance, and absolute risks should be provided for clarity. . Expected frequencies promote understanding and an appropriate sense of importance. . Odds ratios arise from scientific studies but should not be used for general communication. . Graphics need to be chosen with care and awareness of their impact. . P72 . Summarizing and Communicating Numbers. Lots of Number . A variety of statistics can be used to summarize the empirical distribution of data-points, including measures of location and spread. . Skewed data distributions are common, and some summary statistics are very sensitive to outlying values. . Data summaries always hide some detail, and care is required so that important information is not lost. . Single sets of numbers can be visualized in strip- charts, box-and-whisker plots and histograms. . Consider transformations to better reveal patterns, and use the eye to detect patterns, outliers, similarities and clusters. . Look at pairs of numbers as scatter-plots, and time- series as line-graphs. . When exploring data, a primary aim is to find factors that explain the overall variation. . Graphics can be both interactive and animated. . Infographics highlight interesting features and can guide the viewer through a story, but should be used with awareness of their purpose and their impact. . P94 . Why Are We Looking At Data Anyway? Populations and Measurement . Inductive inference requires working from our data, through study sample and study population, to a target population. . Problems and biases can crop up at each stage of this path. . The best way to proceed from sample to study population is to have drawn a random sample. . A population can be thought of as a group of individuals, but also as providing the probability distribution for a random observation drawn from that population. . Populations can be summarized using parameters that mirror the summary statistics of sample data. . Often data does not arise as a sample from a literal population. When we have all the data there is, then we can imagine it drawn from a metaphorical population of events that could have occurred, but didn’t. . P119 . What Causes What? . Causation, in the statistical sense, means that when we intervene, the chances of different outcomes are systematically changed. . Causation is difficult to establish statistically, but well-designed randomized trials are the best available framework. . Principles of blinding, intention-to-treat and so on have enabled large-scale clinical trials to identify moderate but important effects. . Observational data may have background factors influencing the apparent observed relationships between an exposure and an outcome, which may be either observed confounders or lurking factors. . Statistical methods exist for adjusting for other factors, but judgement is always required as to the confidence with which causation can be claimed. . P141 . Modeling Relationships Using Regression . Regression models provide a mathematical representation between a set of explanatory variables and a response variable. . The coefficients in a regression model indicate how much we expect the response to change when the explanatory variable is observed to change. . Regression-to-the-mean occurs when more extreme responses revert to nearer the long-term average, since a contribution to their previous extremeness was pure chance. . Regression models can incorporate different types of response variable, explanatory variables and non- linear relationships. . Caution is required in interpreting models, which should not be taken too literally: ‘All models are wrong, but some are useful. . P187 . Algorithms, Analytics and Prediction . Algorithms built from data can be used for classification and prediction in technological applications . . It is important to guard against over-fitting an algorithm to training data , essentially fitting to noise rather than signal . Algorithms can be evaluated by the classification accuracy , their ability to discriminate between groups , and their overall predictive accuracy . Complex algorithms may lack transparency , and it may be worth trading off some accuracy for comprehension . The use of algorithms and artificial intelligence presents many challenges , and insights into both the power and limitations of machine-learning methods is vital . P204 . How Sure Can We Be About What Is Going On? Estimates and Intervals . Uncertainty intervals are an important part of communicating statistics. . Bootstrapping a sample consists of creating new data sets of the same size by resampling the original data, with replacement. . Sample statistics calculated from bootstrap re- samples tend towards a normal distribution for larger data sets, regardless of the shape of the original data distribution. . Uncertainty intervals based on bootstrapping take advantage of modern computer power, do not require assumptions about the mathematical form of the population and do not require complex probability theory. . P228 . Probability- the Language of Uncertainty and Variability . The theory of probability provides a formal language and mathematics for dealing with chance phenomena. . The implications of probability are not intuitive, but insights can be improved by using the idea of expected frequencies. . The ideas of probability are useful even when there is no explicit use of a randomizing mechanism. . Many social phenomena show a remarkable regularity in their overall pattern, while individual events are entirely unpredictable. . P252 . Putting Probability and Statistics Together . Probability theory can be used to derive the sampling distribution of summary statistics, from which formulae for confidence intervals can be derived. . A 95% confidence interval is the result of a procedure that, in 95% of cases in which its assumptions are correct, will contain the true parameter value. It cannot be claimed that a specific interval has 95% probability of containing the true value. . The Central Limit Theorem implies that sample means and other summary statistics can be assumed to have a normal distribution for large samples. . Margins of error usually do not incorporate systematic error due to non-random causes – external knowledge and judgement is required to assess these. . Confidence intervals can be calculated even when we observe all the data, which then represent uncertainty about the parameters of an underlying metaphorical population. . P304 . Answering Questions and Claiming Discoveries . Tests of null hypotheses - default assumptions about statistical models – form a major part of statistical practice. . A P-value is a measure of the incompatibility between the observed data and a null hypothesis: formally it is the probability of observing such an extreme result, were the null hypothesis true. . Traditionally, P-value thresholds of 0.05 and 0.01 have been set to declare ‘statistical significance’. . These thresholds need to be adjusted if multiple tests are conducted, for example on different subsets of the data or multiple outcome measures. . There is a precise correspondence between confidence intervals and P-values: if, say, the 95% interval excludes 0, we can reject the null hypothesis of 0 at P &lt; 0.05. . Neyman-Pearson theory specifies an alternative hypothesis, and fixes Type I and Type II error rates for the two possible kinds of errors in a hypothesis test. . Separate forms of hypothesis tests have been developed for sequential testing. . P-values are often misinterpreted: in particular they do not convey the probability that the null hypothesis is true, nor does a non-significant result imply that the null hypothesis is true. . P339 . Learning from Experience the Bayesian Way . Bayesian methods combine evidence from data (summarized by the likelihood) with initial beliefs (known as the prior distribution) to produce a posterior probability distribution for the unknown quantity. . Bayes’ theorem for two competing hypotheses can be expressed as posterior odds = likelihood ratio x prior odds. . The likelihood ratio expresses the relative support for two hypotheses from an item of evidence, and is sometimes used to summarize forensic evidence in criminal trials. . When the prior distribution comes from some physical sampling process, Bayesian methods are uncontroversial. However generally a degree of judgement is necessary. . Hierarchical models allow evidence to be pooled across multiple small analyses that are assumed to have parameters in common. . Bayes factors are the equivalent of likelihood ratios for scientific hypotheses, and are a controversial substitute for null-hypothesis significance testing. . The theory of statistical inference has a long history of controversy, but issues of quality of data and scientific reliability are more important. . P360 . How Things Go Wrong . Poor statistical practice has some responsibility for the crisis in the reproducibility of science. . Deliberate fabrication of data appears to be fairly rare, but errors in statistical methods are frequent. . An even greater problem is questionable research practices that tend to lead to exaggerated claims of statistical significance. . In the pipeline by which statistical evidence reaches the public, press offices, journalists and editors add to the flow of unjustified statistical claims through their use of questionable interpretation and communication practices. . P377 . How We Can Do Statistics Better . Producers, communicators and audiences all have a role in improving the way that statistical science is used in society. . Producers need to ensure that science is reproducible. To demonstrate trustworthiness, information should be accessible, intelligible, assessable and useable. . Communicators need to be wary of trying to fit statistical stories into standard narratives. . Audiences need to call out poor practice by asking questions about the trustworthiness of their numbers, their source and their interpretation. . When faced with a claim based on statistical evidence, first feel whether it seems plausible. . P379 . Rules for Effective Statistical Practice . Statistical methods should enable data to answer scientific questions: Ask ‘why am I doing this?’, rather than focusing on which particular technique to use. . | Signals always come with noise: It is trying to separate out the two that makes the subject interesting. Variability is inevitable, and probability models are useful as an abstraction. . | Plan ahead, really ahead: This includes the idea of pre- specification in confirmatory experiments - avoiding researcher degrees of freedom. . | Worry about data quality: Everything rests on the data. . | Statistical analysis is more than a set of computations: Do not just plug into formulae or run procedures in software, without knowing why you are doing so. . | Keep it simple: The main communication should be as basic as possible - do not show off skills in complex modelling unless they are really necessary. . | Provide assessments of variability: With the warning that margins of error are generally bigger than claimed. . | Check your assumptions: And make clear when this has not been possible. . | When possible, replicate!: Or encourage others to do so. . | Make your analysis reproducible: Others should be able to access your data and code. . |",

            "content": ". The Undoing Project by Michael Lewis . isbn-13: 9780393354775 . Audible . “Forty years ago, Israeli psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky wrote a series of breathtakingly original studies undoing our assumptions about the decision-making process. Their papers showed the ways in which the human mind erred, systematically, when forced to make judgments in uncertain situations. Their work created the field of behavioral economics, revolutionized Big Data studies, advanced evidence-based medicine, led to a new approach to government regulation, and made much of Michael Lewis’s own work possible. Kahneman and Tversky are more responsible than anybody for the powerful trend to mistrust human intuition and defer to algorithms. The Undoing Project is about a compelling collaboration between two men who have the dimensions of great literary figures. They became heroes in the university and on the battlefield–both had important careers in the Israeli military–and their research was deeply linked to their extraordinary life experiences. Amos Tversky was a brilliant, self- confident warrior and extrovert, the center of rapt attention in any room; Kahneman, a fugitive from the Nazis in his childhood, was an introvert whose questing self-doubt was the seedbed of his ideas. They became one of the greatest partnerships in the history of science, working together so closely that they couldn’t remember whose brain originated which ideas, or who should claim credit. They flipped a coin to decide the lead authorship on the first paper they wrote, and simply alternated thereafter. This story about the workings of the human mind is explored through the personalities of two fascinating individuals so fundamentally different from each other that they seem unlikely friends or colleagues. In the process they may well have changed, for good, mankind’s view of its own mind.” .",

            "title": "What I read in 2019",
            "content": "I managed to read 36 books in 2019 - slightly off my target of 40, but not bad considering extenuating circumstances. For full disclosure, the total of 36 does include 5 ‘Audible Originals’ that are shorter than a typical book - and in some cases, a bit of a stretch to be called a book. On the other hand the longest book I ‘read’ - Cryptonomicon - was a whopping 1,139 pages / 42 hrs and 44 minutes listening time! The vast majority were audiobooks, but I have started reading physical books again rather than just e-books. . Favorite non-fiction books that I read in 2019: The Half Has Never Been Told by Edward R. Baptist was an eye-opening account of slavery in the period between Independence and the Civil War. He shows in detail how capitalism and profit drove the slave trade, the systematic torture that produced ever increasing cotton yields and how US and European banks created financial instruments with slaves as the underlying collateral. . Educated by Tara Westover deservedly made a lot of ‘Best of 2018’ book lists. It is a gripping and at times difficult-to-read memoir of a girl growing up in a survivalist Mormon family. Difficult because many of her experiences growing up are so harrowing. How she went from being (barely) home-schooled on an Idaho mountain-side to studying in Cambridge and Harvard is worth every minute you spend reading it. . I loved Algorithms to Live By by Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths, especially as a software developer who studied Electrical Engineering rather than Computer Science and have never really got the grounding in Algorithms that CS majors have. This is in no way a dry text book but an enjoyable tour through different categories of algorithms and how they have relevance in every day life outside of a computer program. . Thinking in Systems: A Primer by Donnella Meadows was originally published in 2008 and was a Farnam Street blog recommendation. It’s starts off with the basics of systems’ modelling and feedback mechanisms. Again not a textbook, but an easy to read introduction to systems analysis and how to apply to it to real-world problems. Even though modeling feedback control systems was something I had done back in university, I still found this a valuable read. . Rebooting AI by Gary Marcus and Ernest Davis is a useful counterbalance to the current hyperbole around AI. The authors make a convincing argument that current machine learning methods, including deep learning, are not sufficient to achieve anything like true Artificial General Intelligence. What’s not so clear is what, if anything, will get us there - the authors argue for a renewed focus on understanding human cognition with a hybrid of current machine learning with symbolic inference based on knowledge-bases being the way forward. . I approached Malcom Gladwell’s Talking To Strangers with some trepidation. He is a great storyteller and his books are always a pleasure to read, but the premise or theory underlying some of his previous books (e.g. Blink or Outliers) has often turned out to be somewhat flawed. His latest book doesn’t seem to have a (to my mind at least) controversial underlying theory, so hopefully will stand the test of time better. As an aside, this book seems to be an exception to the general rule that authors shouldn’t narrate their own books and in fact makes great use of the audiobook format, using actual recordings of interviews wherever possible. . Michael Lewis is another great storyteller, and when I finally got around to listening to The Undoing Project I wasn’t disappointed. Maybe I’ll make another attempt at finishing Daniel Kahneman’s Thinking, Fast and Slow in 2020! . Favorite fiction books that I read in 2019: In non-fiction, I really liked Recursion by Blake Crouch - I’m a sucker for anything time-travel related and this story was very well done I thought. I discovered Dervla McTiernan and her detective novels, The Ruin and The Scholar set in my hometown of Galway - she’s no Tana French, but writing is decent enough and the setting makes them compelling, at least for me. Continuing the Irish theme, A Keeper and Holding by Graham Norton were enjoyable. The premise of Redshirts by John Scalzi was very clever and enough to keep me interested through some strangely stilted language. I recommend Righteous and Wrecked by Joe Ide for fans of detective novels and, of course, Michael Connelly (The Night Fire) never fails to please . In it’s own category… I guess that strictly speaking it’s in the fiction category, but The Unicorn Project by Gene Kim is a compelling read for anyone working in software development, especially in an enterprise environment. The follow-up to the brilliant The Phoenix Project, the Unicorn Project is actually set during the same period as the earlier book and gives the Dev side of the DevOps, whereas the Phoenix Project’s viewpoint was more the Ops side. .

Hardcover . “Two leaders in the field offer a compelling analysis of the current state of the art and reveal the steps we must take to achieve a truly robust artificial intelligence. Despite the hype surrounding AI, creating an intelligence that rivals or exceeds human levels is far more complicated than we have been led to believe. Professors Gary Marcus and Ernest Davis have spent their careers at the forefront of AI research and have witnessed some of the greatest milestones in the field, but they argue that a computer beating a human in Jeopardy! does not signal that we are on the doorstep of fully autonomous cars or superintelligent machines. The achievements in the field thus far have occurred in closed systems with fixed sets of rules, and these approaches are too narrow to achieve genuine intelligence. The real world, in contrast, is wildly complex and open- ended. How can we bridge this gap? What will the consequences be when we do? Taking inspiration from the human mind, Marcus and Davis explain what we need to advance AI to the next level, and suggest that if we are wise along the way, we won’t need to worry about a future of machine overlords. If we focus on endowing machines with common sense and deep understanding, rather than simply focusing on statistical analysis and gathering ever larger collections of data, we will be able to create an AI we can trust– in our homes, our cars, and our doctors’ offices. Rebooting AI provides a lucid, clear-eyed assessment of the current science and offers an inspiring vision of how a new generation of AI can make our lives better.” .",

When Dr. Emma Sweeney stumbles across the victim of a hit-and-run outside Galway University early one morning, she calls her boyfriend, Detective Cormac Reilly, bringing him first to the scene of a murder that would otherwise never have been assigned to him. The dead girl is carrying an ID that will put this crime at the center of a scandal–her card identifies her as Carline Darcy, heir apparent to Darcy Therapeutics, Ireland’s most successful pharmaceutical company. Darcy Therapeutics has a finger in every pie, from sponsoring university research facilities to funding political parties to philanthropy –it has even funded Emma’s own ground-breaking research. As the murder investigation twists in unexpected ways and Cormac’s running of the case comes under scrutiny from the department and his colleagues, he is forced to question himself and the beliefs that he has long held as truths. Who really is Emma? And who is Carline Darcy?

The media loves to report on millions, billions, and trillions, but frequently makes basic mistakes or presents such numbers in misleading ways. And misunderstanding numbers can have serious consequences, since they can deceive us in many of our most important decisions, including how to vote, what to buy, and whether to make a financial investment. In this short, accessible, enlightening, and entertaining book, leading computer scientist Brian Kernighan teaches anyone—even diehard math-phobes—how to demystify the numbers that assault us every day. With examples drawn from a rich variety of sources, including journalism, advertising, and politics, Kernighan demonstrates how numbers can mislead and misrepresent. In chapters covering big numbers, units, dimensions, and more, he lays bare everything from deceptive graphs to speciously precise numbers. And he shows how anyone—using a few basic ideas and lots of shortcuts—can easily learn to recognize common mistakes, determine whether numbers are credible, and make their own sensible estimates when needed. Giving you the simple tools you need to avoid being fooled by dubious numbers, Millions, Billions, Zillions is an essential survival guide for a world drowning in big—and often bad—data.” .",

How did Fidel Castro fool the CIA for a generation? Why did Neville Chamberlain think he could trust Adolf Hitler? Why are campus sexual assaults on the rise? Do television sitcoms teach us something about the way we relate to each other that isn’t true? Talking to Strangers is a classically Gladwellian intellectual adventure, a challenging and controversial excursion through history, psychology, and scandals taken straight from the news. He revisits the deceptions of Bernie Madoff, the trial of Amanda Knox, the suicide of Sylvia Plath, the Jerry Sandusky pedophilia scandal at Penn State University, and the death of Sandra Bland—throwing our understanding of these and other stories into doubt. Something is very wrong, Gladwell argues, with the tools and strategies we use to make sense of people we don’t know. And because we don’t know how to talk to strangers, we are inviting conflict and misunderstanding in ways that have a profound effect on our lives and our world. In his first book since his #1 bestseller, David and Goliath, Malcolm Gladwell has written a gripping guidebook for troubled times.” .",

This is a belter of a book.’ Clare Mackintosh, bestselling author of I Let You Go and I See You ‘I’ve been tracking Steve Cavanagh for a few years now and Thirteen is his best, a dead bang beast of a book that expertly combining his authority on the law with an absolutely great thrill ride.

            "content": ". Thinking in systems: a primer by Donella H. Meadows . isbn-13: 9781603580557 . Kindle . “In the years following her role as the lead author of the international bestseller, Limits to Growth—the first book to show the consequences of unchecked growth on a finite planet— Donella Meadows remained a pioneer of environmental and social analysis until her untimely death in 2001. Meadows’ newly released manuscript, Thinking in Systems, is a concise and crucial book offering insight for problem solving on scales ranging from the personal to the global. Edited by the Sustainability Institute’s Diana Wright, this essential primer brings systems thinking out of the realm of computers and equations and into the tangible world, showing readers how to develop the systems-thinking skills that thought leaders across the globe consider critical for 21st-century life. Some of the biggest problems facing the world—war, hunger, poverty, and environmental degradation—are essentially system failures. They cannot be solved by fixing one piece in isolation from the others, because even seemingly minor details have enormous power to undermine the best efforts of too-narrow thinking. While readers will learn the conceptual tools and methods of systems thinking, the heart of the book is grander than methodology. Donella Meadows was known as much for nurturing positive outcomes as she was for delving into the science behind global dilemmas. She reminds readers to pay attention to what is important, not just what is quantifiable, to stay humble, and to stay a learner. In a world growing ever more complicated, crowded, and interdependent, Thinking in Systems helps readers avoid confusion and helplessness, the first step toward finding proactive and effective solutions.” .",

When Elizabeth Keane returns to Ireland after her mother’s death, she’s focused only on saying goodbye to that dark and dismal part of her life. Her childhood home is packed solid with useless junk, her mother’s presence already fading. But within this mess, she discovers a small stash of letters—and ultimately, the truth. Forty years earlier, a young woman stumbles from a remote stone house, the night quiet except for the constant wind that encircles her as she hurries deeper into the darkness away from the cliffs and the sea. She has no sense of where she is going, only that she must keep on. With wistful and evocative prose, A Keeper is sure to appeal to “fans of sensitive character studies” (Publishers Weekly) and brilliantly illustrates Graham Norton’s clear-eyed understanding of human nature and its darkest flaws.” .",

Audible . “With this extraordinary first volume in what promises to be an epoch-making masterpiece, Neal Stephenson hacks into the secret histories of nations and the private obsessions of men, decrypting with dazzling virtuosity the forces that shaped this century. In 1942, Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse - mathematical genius and young Captain in the U.S. Navy - is assigned to detachment 2702. It is an outfit so secret that only a handful of people know it exists, and some of those people have names like Churchill and Roosevelt. The mission of Watrehouse and Detatchment 2702-commanded by Marine Raider Bobby Shaftoe-is to keep the Nazis ignorant of the fact that Allied Intelligence has cracked the enemy’s fabled Enigma code. It is a game, a cryptographic chess match between Waterhouse and his German counterpart, translated into action by the gung-ho Shaftoe and his forces. Fast-forward to the present, where Waterhouse’s crypto-hacker grandson, Randy, is attempting to create a “data haven” in Southeast Asia - a place where encrypted data can be stored and exchanged free of repression and scrutiny. As governments and multinationals attack the endeavor, Randy joins forces with Shaftoe’s tough-as-nails grandaughter, Amy, to secretly salvage a sunken Nazi sumarine that holds the key to keeping the dream of a data haven afloat. But soon their scheme brings to light a massive conspiracy with its roots in Detachment 2702 linked to an unbreakable Nazi code called Arethusa. And it will represent the path to unimaginable riches and a future of personal and digital liberty…or to universal totalitarianism reborn. A breathtaking tour de force, and Neal Stephenson’s most accomplished and affecting work to date, CRYPTONOMICON is profound and prophetic, hypnotic and hyper-driven, as it leaps forward and back between World War II and the World Wide Web, hinting all the while at a dark day- after-tomorrow. It is a work of great art, thought, and creative daring; the product of a truly icon” .",

These never-before-collected adventures recount an age when the Targaryen line still holds the Iron Throne, and the memory of the last dragon has not yet passed from living consciousness. Before Tyrion Lannister and Podrick Payne, there was Dunk and Egg. A young, naïve but ultimately courageous hedge knight, Ser Duncan the Tall towers above his rivals–in stature if not experience. Tagging along is his diminutive squire, a boy called Egg–whose true name is hidden from all he and Dunk encounter. Though more improbable heroes may not be found in all of Westeros, great destinies lay ahead for these two . . . as do powerful foes, royal intrigue, and outrageous exploits.

What should we do, or leave undone, in a day or a lifetime? How much messiness should we accept? What balance of new activities and familiar favorites is the most fulfilling? These may seem like uniquely human quandaries, but they are not: computers, too, face the same constraints, so computer scientists have been grappling with their version of such issues for decades. And the solutions they’ve found have much to teach us. In a dazzlingly interdisciplinary work, acclaimed author Brian Christian and cognitive scientist Tom Griffiths show how the algorithms used by computers can also untangle very human questions. They explain how to have better hunches and when to leave things to chance, how to deal with overwhelming choices and how best to connect with others. From finding a spouse to finding a parking spot, from organizing one’s inbox to understanding the workings of memory, Algorithms to Live By transforms the wisdom of computer science into strategies for human living.” .",

Dodson, once his sidekick, is now his full- fledged partner, hell-bent on giving IQ’s PI business some real legitimacy: a Facebook page, and IQ’s promise to stop accepting Christmas sweaters and carpet cleanings in exchange for PI services.

And when his new confidant turns out to be connected to a dangerous paramilitary operation, IQ falls victim to a threat even a genius can’t see coming. Waiting for Isaiah around every corner is Seb, the Oxford-educated African gangster who was responsible for the death of his brother, Marcus. Only, this time, Isaiah’s not alone.

When a joint FBI-Seattle Police investigation of an international child pornography ring gets too close to certain powerful people, sex-crimes detective Livia Lone becomes the target of a hit that barely goes awry–a hit that had been offered to John Rain, a retired specialist in killings appearing to be from “natural causes.” Suspecting that the FBI themselves were behind the attack, Livia reaches out to former marine sniper Dox. Together, they assemble an ad hoc team to identify and neutralize the threat: Rain; Rain’s estranged lover, Mossad agent and honey-trap specialist Delilah; black op soldiers Ben Treven and Daniel Larison; and their former commander, SpecOps legend Colonel Scott “Hort” Horton. Moving from Japan to Seattle to DC to Paris, the group fights a series of interlocking conspiracies, each edging closer and closer to the highest levels of the US government. With uncertain loyalties, conflicting agendas, and smoldering romantic entanglements, this group is hardly a team. But in a match as uneven as this one, a collective of killers might be just what they need.” .",

One of my favourite authors, Michael Connelly brings together his veteran character Harry Bosch with LAPD detective Renee Ballard, Connelly’s latest creation. If you’re a fan of Connelly then this book will not disappoint - Ballard and Bosch work well together and it seems we will probably see a few more books where they team up. At this point though perhaps I’m too familiar with the pattern of Connelly’s writing - as soon as the character that turned out to be the villain was introduced, it was easy to guess that he was not just a sideshow but would reappear later in the novel. .",

            "content": ". Mistakes Were Made (But Not by Me) by Carol Tavris, Elliot Aronson . Kindle . This was a truly eye-opening deep dive into cognitive dissonance theory and its by-product self-justification. Although I was generally familiar with the term ‘cognitive dissonance’ I had not been exposed to cognitive dissonance theory in any detail. Having read this book, the world we live in today and, in particular, the fact that so many people hold beliefs that seem completely contradictory to clear facts, is much more understandable. . Cognitive dissonance is a state of tension that occurs whenever a person holds two cognitions (ideas, attitudes, beliefs, opinions) that are psychologically inconsistent, such as “Smoking is a dumb thing to do because it could kill me” and “I smoke two packs a day.” | Dissonance produces mental discomfort, ranging from minor pangs to deep anguish; people don’t rest easy until they find a way to reduce it. | Self-justification is the usual mechanism by which people reduce dissonance. People become more certain about something they just did if they can’t undo it or if it came at some cost (time, money, effort etc). Information that is consonant with their belief / decision is accepted and conflicting information is considered biased. | . The first few chapters discuss the pyschology and scientific behaviour and how the brain and memory works. The rest of the book dives into specific examples of how self-justification manifests itself. The chapters on false memory and innocent people convicted of crimes are particularly powerful. . A by-product of reading this book (at elast for me) is that it makes you examine your own deeply-held beliefs and look for evidence of self-justification. The challenge is that we are often blind to the lies we tell and have told ourselves so that self-justification may be very difficult to perceive. .",

After you’ve read a few of her books you’ll know that her protagonists are always changed in some fundamental way by the end, broken along some dimension of their being. You don’t want to be a primary character in one of her novels. . The Witch Elm is somewhat different than her previous Dublin Murder Squad novels in that the narrative isnt described through the eyes of the police investigating the crime but instead through the eyes of the victim. It’s still great and her writing is (as always) breathtaking at times. Unlike, say, Michael Connelly or JK Rowling, she isnt primarily a storyteller but someone who creates scenes and tensions that envelope you. .

A fairly short book, published in 1992, by George Leonard, an Aikido trainer that grew out an article he wrote for Esquire Magazine in 1987. I came across a recommendation for this book and thought I’d check it and am glad I did. It’s not a life-changing book but interesting and full of good advice. . Leonard defines mastery as “the mysterious process during which what is at first difficult becomes progressively easier and more pleasurable through practice”. There is a mastery curve which has relatively brief spurts of progress, each of which is followed by a slight decline to a plateau somewhat higher than that which preceded it. The mastery journey is one in which you must learn to love the plateau. . Leonard describes three character types: . The Dabbler who loves the initial spurt of progress when attempting something new but cannot handle being on the plateau so instead quickly moves to something else. | The Obsessive is a driven bottom-line type of person. He also cannot handle the plateau but instead of moving to something else like the Dabbler, he doubles-down - he doesn’t understand the necessity for periods of development on the plateau. He insists on continuous upward progress but instead crashes when ultimately he cant make it happen. | The Hacker, after getting the hang of something, is happy to stay on the plateau and doesnt seek any further improvement. | . Those on the path to mastery work hard while on the plateau but at the same time learn to love just being there and taking pleasure from working on the platau. Goals and contingencies are important but the exist in the future and the past. Practice, the path of mastery, exists only in the present. . The Five Master Keys: . Instruction | Practice | Surrender: Surrendering to your teacher and to the demands of your discipline. | Intentionality | The Edge: Take risks for the sake of higher performance. | . Quotes . “…the essence of boredom is to be found in the obsessive search for novelty. Satisfaction lies in mindful repetition, the discovery of endless richness in subtle variations on familiar themes.” | “In the woords of the ancient Eastern adage: ‘Before enlightenment, chop wood and carry water. After enlightenment, chop wood and carry water’” | “To be a learner, you’ve got to be willing to be a fool” | .",

We need to assess the quality of the decision using the a-priori information available at the time rather than the after-the-fact result. .

III. “Work Principles” details the principles that govern how Bridgewater Associates works as an idea meritocracy that tries to deliver meaningful work and relationships through radical truth and radical transparency. . It’s refreshing to see someone lay out the blueprint of their thinking in such a systematic way. The principles that Dalio lays out are definitely thought-provoking. I will say that that for me, the first section (“Where I’m Coming From”) was the most interesting and engaging part of the book. “Life Principles” provided much food for thought but “Work Principles” started getting a bit heavy going. . A summary of the principles is giving below: . “Think for yourself to decide 1) what you want, 2) what is true, and 3) what you should do to achieve #1 in light of #2, and do that with humility and open-mindedness so that you consider the best thinking that is available to you.” .

The book gave an interesting non-technical introduction to Critical State Theory and how it can be used to explain phenomena as diverse as earthquakes, forest fires, extinction events, financial markets and wars. Focusing initially on earthquakes, the book explains how scientists have singularly failed to come up with a theory that can predict when and where a major earhtquake will occur. Instead, scientists have found that earthquakes in general follow a power-law that describes how earthquake magnitude relates to frequency - the larger the earthquake, the less likely it is to occur. However, any size of earhquake can occur at any given time. How I understood it, is that complex systems with many interacting elements behave in a highly-path dependent manner and can build up to a critical state where a small ‘nudge’ can cause a very large change in the overall behavior, but could also just precipitate a very small change. . This book definitely left me looking at the world in a different way. The concepts have many potential repercussions to how we see the world and how we interact with it.

            "content": ". Blockchain Basics: A Non-Technical Introduction in 25 Steps by Daniel Drescher . ePub [Apress] . I haven’t read a large number of Blockchain to be able to compare this with others, but I was looking for an introduction that didn’t immediately dive into code or waffle-on at length about the how the technology will transform life as we know it. This book fit the bill pretty well. . The book consists of 25 steps, grouped into 5 major stages, that all together form a learning pathm which incrementally builds the reader’s knowledge of the blockchain. . Stage 1: Terminology and Technical Foundations . Step 1: Thinking in layers and aspects . Systems can be partioned into application vs implementation and functional vs non-functional aspects. | Integrity is a major non-functional aspect, and has three major components: Data Integrity | Behavioural Integrity | Security | . | Most software failures are the result of violated system integrity. | . Step 2: Software Architecture and it’s relation to the Blockchain . Software architectures can be centralized or distributed. | The blockchain is part of the implementation of a distributed software system* | The purpose of the blockchain is to achieve and maintain the integrity of a distributed software system | . Step 3: Recognizing the potential of peer-to-peer systems . Peer-to-peer systems are a specific type of distributed system that allow direct interactions between contractual partners rather than indirect interactions through a middleman. | . Stage 2: Why the Blockchain is needed . Step 4: Discovering the core problem . Integrity and trust are major concerns of peer-to-peer (P2P) systems | Major integrity threats in P2P systems are: Technical failures | Malicious peers | . | The blockchain addresses integrity of a purely distributed P2P system comprised of an unknown number of peers with unknown reliability and trustworthiness. | . Step 5: Disambiguating the term - 4 ways to define the blockchain . The term blockchain can be used as: a name for a data-structure: data in units called blocks, connected together like a chain. | a name for an algorithm: the sequence of intructions that negotiated the information content of many blockchain-data-structured in a P2P system. | a name for a suite of technologies: a combination of blockchain data-structure, algorithm and cryptographic and security technlogies that together achieve integrity in a P2P system. | an umbrella term for purely distributed P2P systems with a common application area | . | Managing ans clarifying ownership is the most prominent application of the blockchain, but not the only one. | The blockchain is a purely distributed peer-to-peer system of ledgers that utilizes a software unit that consist of an algorithm, which negotiates the informational content of ordered and connected blocks of data together with cryptographic and security technologies in order to achieve and maintain its integrity. | . Step 6: Understanding the nature of ownership . Proof of ownership has 3 elements: Identification of the owner | Identification of the object being owned | Mapping the owner to the object | . | Mapping between owners and object can be maintained in a ledger. | Having one ledger is risky as it can be damaged, destroyed or forged. | Can utilize a group of independent ledgers and define ownership based in that version of reality on which the majority of ledgers agree. | The blockchain algorith is responsible for letting individual nodes in a blockchain collectively arrive at one consitent version of the state of ownership. | Cryptography is used to ensure identity, authentication and authorization. | Integrity in a distributed P2P system of ledgers is found in it’s ability to make true statements about ownership and to ensure only the owner can transfer their property rights to others. | . Step 7: Spending Money Twice - Examining a vulnerability of distributed P2P systems . Double-spending can be seen as a problem of maintaining data consistency in distributed P2P systems. | The blockchain is a means to solving the double spending problem | . Stage 3: How the Blockchain works . Step 8: Planning the blockchain . The following tasks are necessary to design a distributed P2P system of ledgers for managing ownership: Describing ownership | Protecting ownership from unauthorized access | Storing transaction data | Preparing ledgers to be distributed in an untrustworthy environment | Distributing the ledgers | Adding and verifying new transactions to the ledgers | Deciding which ledgers represent the truth | . | . Step 9: Documenting Ownership . Transaction data provide the following information for describing a transfer of ownership: An identifier of the account who initiates the transaction and is to transfer ownership to another account | An identifier of that account that is to receive ownership | The amount of the goods to be transferred | The time the transaction is to be done | A fee to be paid to the system for executing the transaction | A proof that the owner of the account who hands off ownership agrees with that transfer | . | The complete history of transaction data is an audit trail that provides evidence of how people acquired and handed off ownership. | Any transaction not being part of that history is regarded as if it never happened. | A transaction is executed by adding it to the history of transaction data and allowing it to influence the result of aggregating them. | The order in which transaction data are added to the history must be preserved in order to yield identical results when aggregating these data. | In order to maintain integrity, only those transaction data are added to the blockchain-data-structure that fulfill the following three criteria: Formal correctness | Semantic correctness | Authorization | . | . Step 10: Hashing Data . Hash functions transform any kind of data into a number of fixed length, regardless of the size of the input data. | There are many different hash functions that differ among others with respect to the length of the hash value they produce. | Cryptographic hash functions are an important group of hash functions that create digital fingerprints for any kind of data. | Cryptographic hash functions exhibit the following properties: Provide hash values for any kind of data quickly | Deterministic | Pseudorandom | One-way usage | Collision resistant | . | Application of hash functions to data can be accomplished by using the following patterns: Repeated hashing | Independent hashing | Combined hashing | Sequential hashing | Hierarchical hashing | . | . Step 11: Hashing in the real world . Hash values can be used: To compare data | To detect whether data that were supposed to stay unchanged have been altered | To refer to data in a change-sensitive manner | To store a collection of data in a change-sensitive manner | To create computationally expensive tasks | . | . Step 12: Identifying and protecting user accounts . The major goal of cryptography is to protect data from being accessed by unauthorized people. | The major cryptographic activities are: Encryption: Protecting data by turning them into cypher text by utilizing a cryptographic key | Decryption: Turning cypher text back into useful data by utilizing a matching cryptographic key | Asymmetric cryptography always uses two complementary keys: cypher text created with one of these keys can only be decrypted with the other key and vice versa. | . | When utilizing asymmetric cryptography in real life, these keys are typically called the public key and private key in order to highlight their role. The public key is shared with everyone, while the private key is kept secret. For this reason, asymmetric cryptography is also called public-private-key cryptography. | There are two classical use cases of public and private keys: Everyone uses the public key to encrypt data that can only be decrypted by the owner of the corresponding private key. This is the digital equivalent to a public mailbox where everyone can put letters in but only the owner can open it. | The owner of the private key uses it to encrypt data that can be decrypted by everyone who possesses the corresponding public key. This is the digital equivalent to a public notice board that proves authorship. | . | The blockchain uses asymmetric cryptography in order to achieve two goals: Identifying accounts: User accounts are public cryptographic keys. | Authorizing transactions: The owner of the account who hands off ownership creates a piece of cypher text with the corresponding private key. This piece of cypher text can be verified by using the corresponding public key, which happens to be the number of the account that hands off ownership. | . | . Step 13: Authorizing transactions . Digital signatures are the digital equivalent to handwritten signatures and serve two purposes: Identify its author uniquely | State agreement of its author with the content of a document and authorize its execution | . | In the blockchain, digital signatures of transactions are cryptographic hash values of transaction data encrypted with the private key that corresponds to the account that hands off ownership. | Digital signatures in the blockchain can be trace back uniquely to one specific private key and to one specific transaction in one process. | . Step 14: Storing transaction data . The blockchain-data-structure is a specific kind of data structure that is made up of ordered units called blocks. | Each block of the blockchain-data-structure consists of a block header and a Merkle tree that contains transaction data. | The blockchain-data-structure consists of two major data structures: an ordered chain of block headers and Merkle trees. | One can imagine the ordered chain of block headers as being the digital equivalent to an old-fashioned library card catalog, where the individual catalog cards are sorted according to the order in which they were added to the catalog. | Having each block header referencing its preceding block header preserves the order of the individual block headers and blocks, respectively, that make up the blockchain-data-structure. | Each block header in the blockchain-data-structure is identified by its cryptographic hash value and contains a hash reference to its preceding block header and a hash reference to the application-specific data whose order it maintains. | The hash reference to the application-specific data is typically the root of a Merkle tree that maintains hash references to the application-specific data. | . Step 15: Using the data store - chaining blocks of data . The steps to be performed in order to add new transaction data to the blockchain-data-structure are: Create a new Merkle tree that contains all new transaction data to be added. | Create a new block header that contains both a hash reference to its preceding header and the root of the Merkle tree that contains the new transaction data. | Create a hash reference to the new block header, which is now the current head of the blockchain-data-structure. | . | Changing data in the blockchain-data-structure requires renewing all hash references starting with the one that directly points to the manipulated data and ending with the head of the whole blockchain-data-structure as well as all hash references in between them. | The blockchain-data-structure pursues a radical all-or-nothing approach when it comes to changing its data: One either changes the whole data structure completely starting from the point that causes the change until the head of the whole chain or one better leave it unchanged in the first place. | All half-hearted, halfway through, or partial changes will leave the whole blockchain-data-structure in an inconsistent state, which will be detected easily and quickly. | Changing the blockchain-data-structure completely is a very elaborate process on purpose. | The high sensitivity of the blockchain-data-structure regarding changes is due to the properties of hash references. | . Step 16: Protecting the data store - discovering the power of immutability . The blockchain protects the history of transaction data from manipulation and forgery by storing transaction data in an immutable data store. | The history of a transaction is made immutable by utilizing two ideas: Storing the transaction data in the change-sensitive blockchain-data-structure, which when being changed requires rewriting the data structure starting at the point that causes the change until the head of the whole chain. | Requiring the solution of a hash puzzle for writing, rewriting, or adding every single block header in the blockchain-data-structure. | . | The hash puzzle is unique for each block header because it depends on its unique content. | The need to rewrite the blockchain-data-structure when it is changed and the costs of doing so make it unattractive to manipulate the history of transaction data in the first place. | Requiring the solution of a hash puzzle for every writing, rewriting or adding of block headers in the blockchain-data-structure turns is into an append-only data store. | A block header contains at least the following data: A hash reference to the header of its preceding block | The root of a Merkle tree that contains transaction data | The difficulty of its hash puzzle | The time when solving the hash puzzle was started | The nonce that solves the hash puzzle | . | . Step 17: Distributing the data store among peers . Computers in a distributed peer-to-peer system communicate with one another via a digital network. | Due to the omnipresence of the Internet, it is compelling to create a distributed peer-to-peer system by connecting the individual nodes via the Internet. | A peer-to-peer system that uses the Internet as a medium of communication is characterized by the following facts: The computers are connected with one another via the Internet. | Each computer is identified by a unique address. | Each computer can disconnect and reconnect to the system at any given time. | Each computer independently maintains a list of peers with which it communicates. | Communication between nodes is based on messages. | Messages are sent from one node to another over the Internet by using their unique addresses. | . | Due to the adversaries of networks, the communication among the nodes is characterized by the following facts: Messages are not guaranteed to arrive at the addressees, but they may get lost instead. | Messages may arrive more than once. | Messages may arrive in a different order than they were sent. | . | The blockchain counteracts the adversaries of communicating over an unreliable network in the following ways: Messages are sent in a gossip style. Every node that receives a message will forward it to the peers it communicates with, which in turn will handle the message in the same way. | Duplicates of transactions or blocks are identified and filtered out based on their cryptographic hash values. | Each node can order the received information because transaction data and block headers contain time stamps. | . | The communication among the computers that make up the peer-to-peer system serves the following three purposes: Keeping existing connections alive | Establishing new connections | Distributing new information | . | Forwarding ownership-related information happens on three occasions: In an ongoing fashion by forwarding new transaction data and new blocks to all nodes that are connected to the system | As an update for nodes that reconnect to the system after being disconnected for a while | As part of the on-boarding procedure that transfers a copy of the whole up-to-date version of the blockchain-data-structure to the new nodes to ensure that they become full-fledged nodes after joining the system | . | . Step 18: Verifying and adding transactions . The blockchain-algorithm is a series of rules and instructions that governs the way in which transaction data are processed and added to the system. | The challenge solved by the blockchain-algorithm is to keep the system open to everyone while ensuring that only valid and authorized transactions are added. | The blockchain-algorithm utilizes the carrot-and-stick approach, combined with competition and peer control. | The major idea of the blockchain-algorithm is to allow all nodes of the system to act as supervisors of their peers and reward them for adding valid and authorized transactions and for finding errors in the work of others. | Due to the rules of the blockchain-algorithm, all nodes of the system have an incentive to process transactions correctly and to supervise and point out any mistakes made by the other peers.” | The blockchain-algorithm is based on the following concepts: Validation rules for transaction data and block headers | Reward for submitting valid blocks | Punishment for counteracting the integrity of the system | Competition among peers for earning reward based on processing speed and quality | Peer control | . | The rules of the competition establish a two-step rhythm that governs the work of every node in the network. At any given point in time, all nodes of the system are in either of the two phases: Evaluating a new block that was created by others | Trying hard to be the next node that creates a new block that has to be evaluated by all others | . | The working rhythm is imposed by the arrival of messages at the individual nodes. | The majority of honest nodes and their striving for reward will outweigh the attempts of dishonest nodes to counteract the integrity of the system. | . Step 19: Choosing a transaction history . Delays in sending new blocks across the network or two nodes creating new blocks nearly at the same time cause the blockchain-data-structure to grow into the shape of a tree or a columnar cactus with branches that arise from a common trunk that represent conflicting versions of the transaction history. | Selecting an identical version of the transaction history is a collective decision-making problem. | Distributed consensus is an agreement among the members of a purely distributed peer-to-peer system in a collective decision-making problem. | The collective decision-making problem of the blockchain is characterized by the following facts: All nodes operate in the identical environment, consisting of the network, nodes that maintain their individual copies of the blockchain-data-structure, and the blockchain-algorithm that governs the behavior of the nodes. | The decision-making problem is to select the identical transaction history across all nodes. | All nodes strive to maximize their individual income earned as a reward for adding new valid blocks to the blockchain-data-structure. | In order to achieve their goals, all nodes send their new blocks to all their peers to have them examined and accepted. As a result, each nodes leaves its individual footprint in the environment that is the collectively maintained blockchain-data-structure. | All nodes use the identical criterion for selecting a history of transaction data. | . | The longest-chain-criterion states that each node independently chooses the path of the tree-shaped blockchain-data-structure that contains the most blocks. | The heaviest-chain-criterion states that each node independently chooses that path of the tree-shaped blockchain-data-structure that has the highest aggregated difficulty. | Selecting one path of the tree-shaped blockchain-data-structure has the following consequences: Orphan blocks | Reclaimed reward | Clarifying ownership | Reprocessing of transactions | A growing common trunk | Eventual consistency | Robustness against manipulations | . | The deeper down the authoritative chain a block is located: The further in the past it was added | The more time has passed since its inclusion in the blockchain-data-structure | The more common effort has been spent on adding subsequent blocks | The less it is affected by random changes of the blocks that belong to the longest chain | The less likely it will be abandoned | The more accepted it is by the nodes of the system | The more anchored it is in the common history of the nodes | . | The fact that certainty concerning the inclusion of blocks in the authoritative chain increases as time goes by and as more blocks are added eventually is called eventually consistency. | A 51 percent attack is an attempt to gather or control the majority of the whole voting power in a collective decision-making process with the goal to turn blocks that are part of the authoritative chain into orphan blocks and establish a new authoritative chain that contains a transaction history that is more favorable from the attackers point of view. | A 51 percent attack has the following characteristics: Economically: Changing the allocation of ownership rights by changing the collective history of transaction data. | Decision making: Gathering the majority of voting power in order to enforce a desired result. | Technically: Undermining the integrity of the system. | Architecturally: Establish at least temporarily a hidden element of centrality that changes the state of the system. | . | . Step 20: Paying for Integrity . The blockchain utilizes fees for compensating its peers for contributing to the integrity of the system. | The instrument of payment used to compensate peers has an impact on major aspects of the blockchain such as: Integrity | Openness | The distributed nature | The philosophy of the system | Desirable properties of an instrument of payment for compensating peers are: | Being available in digital form | Being accepted in the real world | Being accepted in all countries | Not being the subject to capital movement restrictions | Being trustworthy | Not being controlled by one single central organization or state | . | A cryptocurrency is an independent digital currency whose ownership is managed by a blockchain that uses it as an instrument of payment for compensating its peers for maintaining the integrity of the system. | . Step 21: Bringing the pieces together . The blockchain is a purely distributed peer-to-peer system that addresses the following aspects of managing ownership: Describing ownership: History of Transaction Data | Protecting ownership: Digital Signature | Storing transaction data: Blockchain-Data-Structure | Preparing ledgers for being distributed: Immutability | Distributing ledgers: Gossip-Style Information Forwarding Through a Network | Processing new transactions: Blockchain-Algorithm | Deciding which ledger represents the truth: Distributed Consensus | . | Analyzing the blockchain involves the following aspects: The application goal | Its properties | Its internal functioning | . | The blockchain has two application goals: Clarifying ownership | Transferring ownership | . | The blockchain fulfills its application goals while exhibiting the following qualities: Highly available | Censorship proof | Reliable | Open | Pseudoanonymous | Secure | Resilient | Eventually consistent | Keeping integrity | . | Internally the blockchain consists of components that are either specific or agnostic to the application goal of managing ownership. | The application-specific components of the blockchain are: Ownership logic | Transaction data | Transaction processing logic | Transaction security | . | The application-agnostic components are: The blockchain-technology-suite | The purely distributed peer-to-peer architecture | . | The blockchain-technology-suite consists of: Storage logic | Consensus logic | Data processing logic | Asymmetric cryptography | . | . Stage 4: Limitations and how to overcome them . Step 22: Seeing the limitations . The openness of the blockchain and the absence of any form of central control are the fundamentals of its functioning but can also cause limitations for its adoption. | Major technical limitations of the blockchain are: Lack of privacy | The security model | Limited scalability | High costs | Hidden centrality | Lack of flexibility | Critical size | . | The most important nontechnical limitations of the blockchain are: Lack of legal acceptance | Lack of user acceptance | Technical limitations of the blockchain can be overcome by improving the existing technology or by introducing conceptual changes. | The nontechnical limitations of the blockchain can be overcome by educational and legislative initiatives. | . | . Step 23: Reinventing the Blockchain . The blockchain inherently contains the following conflicts: Transparency vs. privacy: On the one hand, transparency is needed for clarifying ownership and preventing double spending, but on the other hand, its users require privacy. | Security vs. speed: On the one hand, protecting the history of transaction data from being manipulated is done by utilizing the computationally expensive proof of work, but on the other hand, speed and scalability are required in most commercial contexts. | . | The transparency vs. privacy conflict has its root in the allocation of reading access rights to the blockchain-data-structure. | The security vs. speed conflict has its root in the allocation of writing access rights to the blockchain-data-structure. | Solving the transparency vs. privacy conflict led to the following versions of the blockchain: Public blockchains grant reading access and the right to create new transactions to all users or nodes. | Private blockchains limit reading access and the right to create new transactions to a preselected group of users or nodes. | . | Solving the security vs. speed conflict led to the following versions of the blockchain: Permissionless blockchains grant writing access to everyone. Every user or node can verify transaction data and create and add new blocks to the blockchain-data-structure. | Permissioned blockchains grant writing access only to a limited group of preselected nodes or users that are identified as trustworthy through an on-boarding process. | . | Combining these restrictions pairwise led to the emergence of four different kinds of blockchains. | Restricting reading or writing access results in consequences on the following properties of the blockchain: The peer-to-peer architecture | The distributed nature | Its purpose | . | The blockchain-technology-suite causes value even in restricted environments for the following reasons: The number of nodes can vary due to technical failures or downtime. | Every distributed system faces the adversaries of networks that make communication on the level of individual messages unreliable. | Even an on-boarding process may not guarantee the trustworthiness of nodes at a 100 percent level. | Even trustworthy nodes may yield wrong results due to technical failures. | . | . Stage 5: Using the Blockchain, Summary and Outlook . Step 24: Using the Blockchain . The blockchain can be considered a purely distributed data store with additional properties such as being immutable, append-only, ordered, time-stamped, and eventually consistent. | Being a generic data store means that the blockchain can store a wide range of data, which in turn makes it usable in a wide range of application areas. | Based on its properties, we can identify the following generic-use patterns of the blockchain: Proof of existence | Proof of nonexistence | Proof of time | Proof of order | Proof of identity | Proof of authorship | Proof of ownership | . | Specific application areas of the blockchain that have already received attention or may receive attention in the future are: Payments | Cryptocurrencies | Micropayments | Digital assets | Digital identity | Notary services | Compliance and audit | Tax | Voting | Record management | . | When analyzing specific blockchain applications or blockchain services, some questions need to be answered: What kind of blockchain is used? | Are the requirements for using the blockchain fulfilled? | What is the added value of using a purely distributed peer-to-peer system? | What is the application idea? | What is the business case? | How are peers compensated for contributing resources to the system? | . | . Step 25: Summarizing and going further . The blockchain has been and will continue to be the subject of further improvements and developments such as variations in its implementation, improving efficiency, improving scalability, and conceptual advances. | Smart contracts, zero-knowledge proofs, and alternative ways to achieve consensus are major areas of conceptual advancement of the blockchain. | Besides it technical merits, the blockchain may be honored for the following long-term accomplishments: Disintermediation | Automation | Standardization | Streamlining processes | Increased processing speed | Cost reduction | Shift toward trust in protocols and technology | Making trust a commodity | Increased technology awareness | . | Possible disadvantages of the blockchain are: Lack of privacy | Loss of personal responsibility | Loss of jobs | Reintermediation | . | Possible usages of the blockchain to be seen in the future are: Limited enthusiast projects | Large-scale commercial projects | Governmental projects | . | .",

            "content": ". Silos, Politics and Turf Wars: A Leadership Fable about Destroying the Barriers That Turn Colleagues Into Competitors by Patrick Lencioni . Audible Unabridged, narrated by Eric Conger . This was a re-read (re-listen?) as I had read this a number of years ago when it first came out. I wanted to deploy the idea of defining a thematic goal for my team at work, so I downloaded the audiobook to listen to on my commute. . Introducing the Model . To avoid politics and turf battles, leaders must establish a rallying cry a single overriding theme that remains the top priority of the entire leadership team for a given period of time. In turn, this rallying cry or “thematic goal” serves to align employees throughout the organization and provides an objective tool for resetting direction when things get out of sync. . While it is useful for companies to have both a long term vision and a set of short term, tactical objectives, the thematic goal is intended to bridge the two. It makes the vision more tangible and it gives the tactical objectives more context. . For the thematic goal to take root in an organization, it needs to originate at the executive team level. Once the thematic goal is set for the organization, each department can then create a corresponding thematic goal. . Definitions . Thematic Goal: A single, qualitative focus or rallying cry that is shared by the entire leadership team and ultimately, by the entire organization-and that applies for only a specified period of time. . Defining Objectives: The temporary, qualitative components that serve to clarify exactly what is meant by the Thematic Goal; shared by all members of the team (and usually varying in number from four to six). . Standard Operating Objectives: Other key objectives that an executive team must focus on and monitor. These objectives do not go away from period to period and often include topics such as: revenue, expenses, customer satisfaction, quality etc. .",

            "content": ". Radical Candor: Be a Kick-Ass Boss Without Losing Your Humanity by Kim Malone Scott . Kindle . I first came across the author in a article describing the TED Talk she had given on the primary concept behind Radical Candor - that as a manager you need to both Care Personally and Challenge Directly. The article and talk resonated well with me but when the book came out I was worried that it really only had one great idea that would be repeated in different variations ad nauseum through the book. I was pleasantly suprised to found that the book had greater depth and a number of valuable lessons in it. . Part 1: A New Management Philosophy . Chapter 1: Build Radically Candid Relationships . Bosses guide a team to achieve results | Manager’s three areas of responsibility: Guidance: Create a culture of guidance (praise and criticism) that will keep everyone moving in the right direction. | Team-building: Understand what motivates each person on your team well enough to avoid burnout or boredon and keep the team cohesive. | Results: Drive results collaboratively | . | “It isn’t simply a matter of allowing your approach to your responsibilities to show that you care, however; you must also care deeply about people while being prepared to be hated in return.” | ‘Radical Candor’ is what happens when you put ‘Care Personally’ and ‘Challenge Directly’ together | . Chapter 2: Get, Give, and Encourage Guidance . ‘Obnoxious aggression’ - when you challenge directly but don’t care personally | ‘Manipulative insincerity’ - when you don’t challenge directly or care personally | ‘Ruinous empathy’ - when you care personally but don’t challenge directly . | Radical candor: “Whisper: ‘Your fly is down!’ “ | Obnoxious aggression: “Shout: ‘Look, his fly is down!’ “ | Manipulative insincerity: Silent - worried about your feelings | Ruinous empathy: Silent - worried about his feelings | . Chapter 3: Understand What Motivates Each Person on Your Team . Superstar Steep growth trajectory | Change agent | Ambitious at work | Want new opportunities | . | Rockstar Gradual growth trajectory | Force for stability | Ambitious outside of work | Happy in the current role | . | Your job as manager is not to provide purpose but instead to get to know each of your direct reports well enough to understand how each one derives meaning from work . | Excellent Performance: Keep your top performers top of mind | Excellent Performance / Gradual growth trajectory: Recognize, reward but don’t promote | Excellent Performance / Steep growth trajectory: Keep superstars challenged (and figure out who’ll replace them when they move on) | Managing the middle: Raise the bar - there’s no such thing as a B-player | Poor Performance / Negative growth trajectory: Part ways | Questions to consider before letting someone go: Have you given Radically Candid guidance? | How is this person’s poor performance affecting the rest of the team? | Have you sought out a second opinion, spoken to someone whom you truyst and with whom you can talk the problem through? | . | Common lies managers tell themselves to avoid firing someone who needs to be fired: It will get better | Somebody is better than nobody | A transfer is the answer | It’s bad for morale | . | Low performance / Steep growth trajectory: Manager, look yourself in the mirror! Wrong role | New to role; too much too fast | Personal problems | Poor fit | . | No permanent markers: people change and you have to change with them | . Have you ever underestimated an employee’s contributions because they weren’t gunning for a promotion? What happened? Did you regret it? Have you ever clipped the wings of an employee on a steep growth trajectory? What happened? Did you regret it? Are you more at risk of being an absentee manager or a micromanager? What kinds of situations push you towards one of these modes? Are you currently on a gradual or steep growth trajectory? Were you ever on the opposite one? . Chapter 4: Drive Results Collaboratively . Have you ever tried to tell a team of people what to do? What were the results? Which step(s) of the Get Stuff Done (GSD) Wheel are easiest or most comfortable for you? What steps do you tend to skip? Where do you get stuck? What are some of the practices your team or organization has today that fall into the different steps of the GSD wheel? Are you a quiet listener or a loud listener? Do you want to foster a culture of debate on a team? If so, how will you do it? If not, why not? How do you help your team make decisions? Are you worried you grab too many decisions? . Part 2: Tools &amp; Techniques . Chapter 5: Relationships . What activities do you do to stay centered? Describe an experience when you weren’t able to bring your best self to work. What happened? How do you build trust with your direct reports/ staff? What strategies or activities have been most effective, and how can you tell? . Chapter 6: Guidance . Have you solicited feedback from your direct reports/staff? If so, how have you done it, and has it been successful? Do you have a go-to question for soliciting feedback? What is it? What are some of the ways that you have rewarded criticism? Which of the book’s tips for giving guidance did you find most helpful? What’s something you could do tomorrow with someone on your team to offer Radical Candor? . Chapter 7: Team . Do you or can you begin facilitating “Career Conversations” with your direct reports, as a way of caring personally and helping them map out their career trajectories? Do you know the balance of rock stars and superstars on your team? How do you think about growth for different people? Did any of the book’s suggestions for hiring and firing resonate as applicable to your team/company? . Chapter 8: Results . How do you approach 1:1 meetings? How’s that different than the recommendations laid out in the book? Will you change your 1:1’s? How do you help nurture new ideas? Are there ideas from the book that you’ll adopt? Do you hold staff meetings? How do they compare to the approach in the book? Any recommendations that you’ll incorporate?

I went back and read all the novels from the start and have eagerly read every new release since, plus pretty much everything else that Connelly has written. I’m not particularly a crime-fiction addict but have gotten addicted to Connelly’s writing and his characters and the LA setting for his stories. The main character, Harry Bosch, is (over the series of books) so richly drawn that he almost feels real to me. Amazon created the Bosch tv series a few years back, and its pretty good, but doesn’t compare to the Bosch that I’ve built in my head over the years from reading the books. . In the overall body of work, The Wrong Side of Goodbye doesn’t particularly stand out. For a Connelly fan though, it’s essential reading. One of the signs of the quality of the writing for me is that I’m barely conscious of the writing - you just slip into the story and get carried along. . “Everybody counts or nobody counts” - Harry Bosch .",

She’s nowhere near as prolific as Connelly - I think this is her sixth novel. Each novel is set in Ireland, most of them cases for the (fictitious) Dublin Murder Squad. Each novel takes a minor character from the previous book and makes him or her the main protagonist in the new book. . I just love her writing and the edgy, slightly creepy atmosphere she manages to create. Most of her novels so far have had a shadow of the supernatural hanging over them without quite losing touch with reality - just enough to make you wonder if something not quite natural is at play. Her last novel, The Secret Place probably probably had the most overtly supernatural elements, whereas this novel probably has the least. The other element to most of her novels to date is that the protagonist in each somehow comes undone in some way, even as he or she solves the case, some fatal flow in their character causes their victory to turn out hollow in some way. That’s one of the things I’ve really liked in her work. The Trespasser goes easier on the protagonists than her previous work - there’s no personal tragedy awaiting them at the end, which is good and bad. This seems to be her most straight-up detective story of her novels so far. . Overall, though, another excellent novel from Tana French - can’t wait for the next one! .",

Qasim Rashid is an acquaintance of mine - it would probably be a stretch to call him a friend. This book was funded on Kickstarter and I was one of the 337 backers. Having seen Qasim speak at various events and clips of his regular interviews on Fox News and CNN etc (he’s an official spokesperson for the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, USA - an organization which I am also a member), I was expecting a decent enough book, but not necessarily anything exceptional. . I was blown away by this book. I received a printed copy as part of the Kickstarter (one of the few physical books I read in 2016) and once I started reading it I couldn’t stop. The book is basically a series of stories from Qasim’s life, as well as stories from a number of guest contributors. The theme is reflected in the title of the book - the need for people from different backgrounds to discard their pre-conceptions about what the “other” is like and just talk to each other, listen to each other’s stories and find mutual understanding. . I was deeply moved by ‘A Parent by Any Other Name’, a chapter contributed by NICU (neonatal intensive care unit) nurse, Nusrat Jehan Chaudhry, who cares for premature infants in the NICU but cannot have children of her own. Much of the book is about being Muslim in the US and the need for interpersonal dialog between people of different faiths, but there are also a number of powerful storeis here on race and the continuing struggle of African-Americans for equal treatment in the USA. There are stories from white and black Christians, from Jews and Atheists. . Read this book - you’ll be glad you did. .",

Chaos Monkeys: Obscene Fortune and Random Failure in Silicon Valley by Antonio Garcia Martinez | Disrupted: My Misadventure in the Start-Up Bubble by Dan Lyons | The Hard Thing About Hard Things: Building a Business When There Are No Easy Answers by Ben Horowitz | . Three books set in startup land, each with a very different perspective on the startup experience. . The most enjoyable of the books is Chaos Monkeys. The author, Antonio Garcia Martinez, describes his journey from being a Strat at Goldman Sachs to moving to join an advertising startup in Silicon Valley to founding his own startup to selling the company to Twitter while engineering a job for himself at Facebook to his ultimate ejection from Facebook. He comes across as quite a rascal, super-smart, ascerbic and driven; someone who doesn’t suffer fools gladly and by his account he comes across a lot of fools on his journey. . For me the most interesting part of the book was the short period running his own startup - breaking free of the company he was working for, getting accepted into Y-Combinator, dealing with angel investors and VCs, to being acqui-hired by Twitter (with the twist that he himself is acqui-hired by Facebook). I found it fascinating and educational even without all the salacious insider-gossip-type details the author throws in. . I was less impressed by Disrupted, the story of an old-school writer/editor who gets laid off by Newsweek and decides to venture into startup land, albeit in Boston rather than Silicon Valley. I think I was put off by the snarky, “I’m the only sane person in the building” tone to the book - you could sense an almost continuous rolling of the eyes. There’s definitely another side to this story that I would be interested in hearing about. That being said, the company he joins, HubSpot, does seem highly dysfunctional. The behavior Lyons describes seems more like very poor management practices than some unique aspect of modern-day startups. He also is very sarcastic about the DiSC Assessment which I happen to find very useful, even if the underlying science is a bit shaky - that probably biased me against the author ;-) . Twenty minutes in to the audiobook version of The Hard Thing About Hard Things I had a foreboding that it might be a waste of time - the books starts off with some anecdotes about the author’s youth that seemed a bit shallow. However, the book does improve greatly and by the end I was glad that I had read it. Although the book does talk about the author’s experiences in two different startups, it concerns itself mostly with the phase when I started is well-funded has a sizeable number of people working for it and needs to act like a proper company - not the three guys hacking away in a rented apartment that Chaos Monkeys describes. As such it offers a lot of advice for someone transitioning from Founder to CEO. Not sure I’ll ever get to the place where his advice will come in useful, but a worthwhile read nonetheless. .",

After the last season of the tv series finished, I wanted to remind myself of the differences between the books and tv series, so I started to re-read/re-listen to the books (mostly re-listen to them on audiobook). As with the first reading I got through the first three books very quickly and enjoyed reminding myself of the plot intricacies and nuanced characterization that the tv series could not show. However, things slowed down dramatically with the fourth book, A Feast for Crows, and it was a bit of a slog to get to the end. So much so that I couldn’t really motivate myself to start the fifth book. Perhaps I will read it prior to the start of the next season of the tv series. .",

I read this at it was chosen as the first book for the Farnam Street Blog Virtual Reading Group. It’s unlikely to be something I would have naturally read otherwise, but it turned out to be fascinating read. . The book is essentially a tour through the birth of the theory of evolution, through to island biogeography and conservation biology. You get to meet the scientists at the heart of these developments from Alfred Russel Wallace and Charles Darwin, to E.O. Wilson, Jared Diamond and many others. You also get to tour the world from Indonesia to the Galapagos to Madagascar to Tasmania and many other places. You also get to meet many different species of animal, some of which are now extinct and many of which may be on their way. It’s a long book, but never boring. . The book is replete with interesting stories. Although almost everyone has heard of the Dodo, another animal mentioned in the book is the Passenger Pigeon. Now extinct, there were 3-5 billion of them in North America in the 18th and 19th centuries, but they became extinct by 1900. . Having only ever studied a minimal amount of biology at school, I really only had a shallow understanding of evolution and how new species are created. My understanding is much improved after reading this book, though it has now opened a whole new set of questions for me. . One other benefit in reading this book is that you’ll pick up a plethora of new and interesting words for your vocabulary. This is where the Kindle really comes in handy, as you can just highlight a word to bring up the dictionary entry for it. Unfortunately, I didn’t make note of those interesting words as I was reading and can no longer remember any of them - a lesson for the future. Going forwards I will be adding all the interesting words to my notes for the book on the kindle. .",

This is a quick and easy introduction to OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) - a performance management system that’s popular in Silicon Valley. The book is another one of those ‘business fables’ (a la Patrick Lencioni) that gets its points across via a fictional story. As for most of these books, dont expect a work of art, but its an effective way to get information across and more enjoyable than reading a dry treatise on a management topic. At the end the book has a section that reviews the model presented in the ‘fable’. . I like the concept of OKRs and they seem like a simple yet effective way to set goals for a team or organization. . Model . O = Objective This is what you want to accomplish. Should be qualitative and inspirational, make you want to get out of bed in the morning. . KR = Key Results These are how you know you’ve achieved your objective. They should be quantitative stretch targets (difficult to achieve, but not impossible). Each KR starts out with a 50% confidence level that it will be achieved. The confidence level is adjusted every week to indicate how close to achieving the KR you are. . OKRs are set at the company or team level either annually or quartlerly. For small companies/teams, a single OKR is preferable; 2-3 are probably acceptable for a larger organization; 5 is too many to remember and track. . Health Metrics These are metrics you want to protect while achieving your OKRs. . Weekly Priorities These are the 3 to 5 things you need to do each week to help achieve the OKRs.

David Marquet | It’s Your Ship: Management Techniques from the Best Damn Ship in the Navy by Michael Abrashoff | . These are two books that try and provide leadership and management guidance based on the experiences of the authors in the U.S. Navy - Marquet as commander of a nuclear powered submarine, the USS Santa Fe, Abrashoff as commander of a guided missile destroyer, the USS Benfold. I had read It’s Your Ship some years earlier, and re-read it after reading Turn the Ship Around. . Both books provide the same general message - that of empowering your team to make decisions and take the initiative. Both contained entertaining stories about the ups and downs - pun intended! - of naval life. Although I enjoyed reading both, I think Turn the Ship Around has more useful takeaways. . Marquet’s book details his transformation from the traditional ‘Leader-Follower’ model typically seen in the navy as well as in business, where the leader gives the orders and his or her followers carry them out, to a ‘Leader-Leader’ model where followers are empowered to make decisions about how to carry out the leader’s intent. This manifested itself in the crew of the USS Santa Fe moving from asking permission from a superior to carry out an action (“Permission to …., Sir?” - “Permission granted”) to one of declaring intent (“I intend to …, Sir” - “Very well”). The difference being that the former transfers responsibility to the leader who is giving the order, whereas the latter shifts ownership of the action to the person carrying it out. .",

With a potential move to the UK looming, and with it the strong likelihood of having to downsize our family’s living accomodations, I thought this book would inspire me to do something about all my stuff and provide practical tips on how to do so.

The material would make a great TedTalk or a long blog post, but as a book it was a chore to get through to the end. .

            "content": ". Meditations by Marcus Aurelius . I’ve seen this book recommended many times by different people. I ended up getting the audiobook on Audible and backed it up with a Kindle version. The eBook is the Dover Thrift Edition - a modernized version of the George Long translation. I’m not entirely sure which translation is used in the audiobook. The narrator is pretty good but I found the density of the prose in the book required a level of concentration not typical when listening to audiobooks. There are a lot of ideas presented in the book requiring contemplation, but if you even briefly get distracted by your contemplations the audiobook has moved on. I think this why I generally prefer listen to fiction on audiobook rather than non-fiction, though I find history also seems to work well on audiobook. . As to Meditations, I understand now why so many have recommended this book. Marcus Aurelius was a Roman Emperor who ascended to the throne in 161 AD. This book contains his reflections on life and how to live it, based on the precepts of Stoicism, of which Aurelius was a disciple. Meditations is actually made of up 12 books. The first book is a list of people who have influenced his life and what he learnt from each. I found this to be very profound - the idea that there is something to be learnt from everyone that you interact with. It certainly got me thinking about the people who have influenced me and what I learnt from them - something I would like to put in to writing at some point in my life. The rest of the books are a series of meditations on various aspects of life. On first study, I couldn’t easily discern specific themes for each book though. . This is a book to return to multiple times. I have read that the 2002 translation by Gregory Hays is more easily digestible, others recommend the 1964 transation by Maxwell Staniforth . There definitely seems to be a lot of variability between translations. . I really liked the Stoic philosophy as presented in Meditations - I find a lot of congruence between it and the fundamental teachings of Islam, with one or two basic differences. The Serenity Prayer: . God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, Courage to change the things I can, And wisdom to know the difference. . could easily be a succinct encapsulation of the philosophy presented in Meditations. . A random quote from Mediations - Book VII, line 54: . Everywhere and at all times it is in your power piously to acquiesce in your present condition, and to behave justly to those aroud you, and to exert your skill upon your present thoughts, that nothing shall steal into them without being well examined. .",

Do No Harm: Stories of Life, Death, and Brain Surgery by Henry Marsh | When Breath Becomes Air by Paul Kalanithi | Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End by Atul Gowande | . I read these three books all on a medical theme in a row. They were three of the best books I read all year - all highly recommended. (I actually listened to the audiobook version of all three - I can recommend the audio versions of Do No Harm and Being Mortal, but found the narrator of When Breath Becomes Air to be insufferable - I suggest you stick to the print or ebook version of that book.) They each provide a different viewpoint on life and death, without being overly morose or heavy. . Do No Harm is a series of vignettes by retired British neurosurgeon, Dr Henry Marsh. It is a truly compelling read with insights into life, death, medicine, success, failure and much more besides. The author is refreshingly honest about his failures as a surgeon in addition to the soaring successes. I didnt think I’d like it as much as I did. One to go back to again. . When Breath Becomes Air ended up on many best-of-2016 lists, and deservedly so. The book is a memoir of a by-all-accounts brilliant young neurosurgeon, nearing the end of his training, who is diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. The author is..was.. a gifted writer as well as a talented surgeon, and it shows in this book. He started writing the book after the diagnosis and died before he could fully complete it. It’s a book that forces to think deeply about life, death and everything in between. The title comes from Caelica 83, a poem by Baron Brooke Fulke Greville: . You that seek what life is in death, Now find it air that once was breath. New names unknown, old names gone: Till time end bodies, but souls none. Reader! then make time, while you be, But steps to your eternity. . Being Mortal is an exploration of aging and death, and our society’s approach to end-of-life care. I really enjoyed Gowande’s book The Checklist Manifesto and his occasional articles in The New Yorker and thought this book was thought-provoking, moving and eloquent. A must-read, especially for those of us with aging parents, or indeed anyone who hopes to live to an old age. .",

Each book typically also has a section where the model is also presented in a more conventional manner.

Both the PDF and ePub formats seem to be closer the mobi format to the typesetting and layout you would get in a printed book. . I’m not entirely sure what inspired me to purchase this book - I’m not, in general, a very artsy person. I guess it’s the idea that we can use algorithms to create something aesthetically pleasing. I learned a lot from this book, even though I have singularly failed to take what I learnt and actually try and create some art.

Processing is a pretty cool platform for visualization - the Processing language is a variant of Java. However, there is now a Python mode for Processing - I generally tried to translate the code in the book to the Python version. . Part 2 is about randomness and noise.

Your First 100 Days in a New Executive Job has a reasonably similar approach to The New Leader’s 100-Day Action Plan. It has more stories and anecdotes than the latter . MODELS .

I went searching for his books on Amazon, and while they have hardcopy versions of the books referred to in the article, the only e-book available was this one. I purchased it as it was reasonably priced. . It’s a mildly interesting set of quotes from, about or related to Sherlock Holmes. While I’m not a Sherlock Holmes obsessive, I am a fan. I found the book pleasant enough to skim through, but not overly enlightening. Not a book to go out of your way for. .",

I had previously read a couple of Peter Clines novels (“14” and “The Fold”) and really enjoyed them. They had a slightly steampunk feel to them and were clever and creepy at the same time. When I found out he had written a series of novels that were a mashup of DC and Marvel-style super-heroes with the zombie-apocalypse, I was intrigued. . Overall the series was great fun to read - not high art, but well-written. The scenario presented was, I thought, well thought-through so that you didn’t spend all your time picking holes in the story. The writing has surprising (for a super-hero/zombie novel) depth at times - for example this exchange from “Ex-Isle”: . I stood straight and turned to him. “Twenty-two days ago, on the roof of Hollywood and Highland, you told me you wished to be a symbol of hope. This is the challenge of hope versus fear, George. Fear is a simple, base emotion felt by every mammal, one that requires no rational though, no logic. It is an easy thing to rule by fear.” . He looked up. “I don’t want us to be ruling by–” . “It is also”, I continued, “an easy thing to be ruled by it. Making decisions based on fear requires no effort. In challenging times, many people prefer such a path. It is easier to be scared of a situation than to make the effort to understand it. Fear provides an excuse to avoid responsibility. Even before the ex-virus, there were many people throughout history who took advantage of this tendency.” .",

            "content": ". The Effective Manager by Mark Horstman . I started listening to the Manager Tools podcast (Mark Horstman and Mike Auzenne) over ten years ago and am a big fan of their no-nonsense, practical approach to management. I paid for myself to attend one of their Effective Manager conferences (although I think it was called something different back them) when I worked in Chicago. So when I heard that Mark Horstman was going to release a book, I made sure to order a copy. In fact I got both a signed hardcover as well as the eBook for reference on the go. I even gave a copy to every person on my former management team when I moved roles. I don’t necessarily agree with all their advice - and they are very opinionated - but I appreciate that their advice is detailed and actionable. They’ve really thought through this stuff. . Though the book is relatively slim - the podcast material collected over 10 years is voluminous and wouldn’t fit in a single volume - this book covers the core Manager Tools guidance. . For me the heart of the book is actually in the Afterword, and is probably the core reason why I like these guys so much: . …in all the details and recomendations, I hope I haven’t obscured what the engine of your greatness as a manager can be: Love. If you want to be a great manager, do these things with love. What I mean here is professional love: the willingness to risk yourself for the benefit of another. It means doing somethinh that may be a little more difficult for you, as a way of showing respect for your colleagues and your organization. You can be demanding while also showing respect for your team. You don’t have to withhold positive feedback. You can give negative feedback with love in your heart. You can deliver tough messages with kindness. You don’t have to be mean, short, or disrespectful to challenge people. You don’t have to be brusque or rude. You don’t have to “act like the boss”. Nor do you have to sugarcoat hard messages. Be direct, and be kind doing it. That takes love. . Highly recommended for any manager or wanna-be manager. . MODEL .
