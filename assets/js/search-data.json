Publisher’s Description: “Named a “must read” by Susan Cain, “endlessly fascinating” by Daniel Pink, and “bursting with practical insights” by Adam Grant. A former rocket scientist reveals the habits, ideas, and strategies that will empower you to turn the seemingly impossible into the possible. Rocket science is often celebrated as the ultimate triumph of technology. But it’s not. Rather, it’s the apex of a certain thought process – a way to imagine the unimaginable and solve the unsolvable. It’s the same thought process that enabled Neil Armstrong to take his giant leap for mankind, that allows spacecraft to travel millions of miles through outer space and land on a precise spot, and that brings us closer to colonizing other planets. Fortunately, you don’t have to be a rocket scientist to think like one. In this accessible and practical book, Ozan Varol reveals nine simple strategies from rocket science that you can use to make your own giant leaps in work and life – whether it’s landing your dream job, accelerating your business, learning a new skill, or creating the next breakthrough product. Today, thinking like a rocket scientist is a necessity. We all encounter complex and unfamiliar problems in our lives. Those who can tackle these problems – without clear guidelines and with the clock ticking – enjoy an extraordinary advantage. Think Like a Rocket Scientist will inspire you to take your own moonshot and enable you to achieve liftoff.” .",

Publisher’s Description: “Is it worth swimming in shark-infested waters to surf a 50-foot, career- record wave? Is it riskier to make an action movie or a horror movie? Should sex workers forfeit 50 percent of their income for added security or take a chance and keep the extra money? Most people wouldn’t expect an economist to have an answer to these questions–or to other questions of daily life, such as who to date or how early to leave for the airport. But those people haven’t met Allison Schrager, an economist and award-winning journalist who has spent her career examining how people manage risk in their lives and careers. Whether we realize it or not, we all take risks large and small every day. Even the most cautious among us cannot opt out– the question is always which risks to take, not whether to take them at all. What most of us don’t know is how to measure those risks and maximize the chances of getting what we want out of life. In An Economist Walks into a Brothel, Schrager equips readers with five principles for dealing with risk, principles used by some of the world’s most interesting risk takers. For instance, she interviews a professional poker player about how to stay rational when the stakes are high, a paparazzo in Manhattan about how to spot different kinds of risk, horse breeders in Kentucky about how to diversify risk and minimize losses, and a war general who led troops in Iraq about how to prepare for what we don’t see coming. When you start to look at risky decisions through Schrager’s new framework, you can increase the upside to any situation and better mitigate the downsides.” .",

Publisher’s Description: “The legendary advertising guru—Ogilvy UK’s vice chairman—and star of three massively popular TED Talks, blends the science of human behavior with his vast experience in the art of persuasion in this incomparable book that decodes successful branding and marketing in the vein of Freakonomics, Thinking Fast and Slow, and The Power of Habit. When Rory Sutherland was a trainee working on a direct mail campaign at the famed advertising firm OgilvyOne, he noticed that very small changes in design often had immense effects on the number of consumer responses. Yet no one he worked with knew why. Sutherland began taking stock of each effective yet nebulous trick—”the thing which has no name”—he discovered. As he rose in the advertising industry, he began to understand why these things had no name: no one was interested in quantifying them, cataloguing them, or really investigating them. So, he did it himself. Like classic behavioral economists Daniel Kahneman and Richard Thaler, Sutherland peels away hidden, often irrational human behaviors that explain how the world around us functions. In How to Be an Alchemist he examines why certain ads work and the broader truths they tell us about who we are. Why do people prefer stripy toothpaste, and how might that help us design retirement plans that young people would actually buy? Why do we think orange juice is healthy, and how does the same principle guide our feelings about nuclear reactors? Why do budget airlines advertise services they don’t offer—and what might insurance companies learn from them about keeping healthcare costs low? Filled with startling and profound conclusions, Sutherland’s journey through the world of advertising and its surprising lessons for human behavior is insightful, brilliant, eye-opening, and irresistibly fun.” .",

Publisher’s Description: “The hero of The Poet and The Scarecrow is back in the new thriller from #1 New York Times bestselling author Michael Connelly. Jack McEvoy, the journalist who never backs down, tracks a serial killer who has been operating completely under the radar–until now. Veteran reporter Jack McEvoy has taken down killers before, but when a woman he had a one-night stand with is murdered in a particularly brutal way, McEvoy realizes he might be facing a criminal mind unlike any he’s ever encountered. McEvoy investigates—against the warnings of the police and his own editor—and makes a shocking discovery that connects the crime to other mysterious deaths across the country. But his inquiry hits a snag when he himself becomes a suspect. As he races to clear his name, McEvoy’s findings point to a serial killer working under the radar of law enforcement for years, and using personal data shared by the victims themselves to select and hunt his targets. Called “the Raymond Chandler of this generation” (Associated Press), Michael Connelly once again delivers an unputdownable thriller that reveals a predator operating from the darkest corners of human nature—and one man courageous and determined enough to stand in his way.” .",

Through the young eyes of Scout and Jem Finch, Harper Lee explores with rich humor and unswerving honesty the irrationality of adult attitudes toward race and class in the Deep South of the 1930s. The conscience of a town steeped in prejudice, violence, and hypocrisy is pricked by the stamina and quiet heroism of one man’s struggle for justice—but the weight of history will only tolerate so much. One of the best-loved classics of all time, To Kill a Mockingbird has earned many distinctions since its original publication in 1960. It has won the Pulitzer Prize, been translated into more than forty languages, sold more than forty million copies worldwide, and been made into an enormously popular movie. It was also named the best novel of the twentieth century by librarians across the country (Library Journal). “ .",

In this controversial and exciting listen, Pollan explores caffeine’s power as the most-used drug in the world—and the only one we give to children (in soda pop) as a treat. . Pollan takes us on a journey through the history of the drug, which was first discovered in a small part of East Africa and within a century became an addiction affecting most of the human species. Caffeine, it turns out, has changed the course of human history—won and lost wars, changed politics, dominated economies. What’s more, the author shows that the Industrial Revolution would have been impossible without it. The science of how the drug has evolved to addict us is no less fascinating. And caffeine has done all these things while hiding in plain sight!

Publisher’s Description: “Ebola, SARS, Hendra, AIDS, and countless other deadly viruses all have one thing in common: the bugs that transmit these diseases all originate in wild animals and pass to humans by a process called spillover. In this gripping account, David Quammen takes the reader along on this astonishing quest to learn how, where from, and why these diseases emerge and asks the terrifying question: What might the next big one be?” . Quotes . Any such spillover in the reverse direction—from humans to a nonhuman species—is known as an anthroponosis. The famous mountain gorillas, for instance, have been threatened by anthroponotic infections such as measles, carried by ecotourists who come to dote upon them. . . With influenza and many other diseases the order is reversed, high infectivity preceding symptoms by a matter of days. A perverse pattern: the danger, then the warning. That probably helped account for the scale of worldwide misery and death during the 1918–1919 influenza: high infectivity among cases before they experienced the most obvious and debilitating stages of illness. The bug traveled ahead of the sense of alarm. And that infamous global pandemic, remember, occurred in the era before globalization. Everything nowadays moves around the planet faster, including viruses. . . The much darker story remains to be told, probably not about this virus but about another. When the Next Big One comes, we can guess, it will likely conform to the same perverse pattern, high infectivity preceding notable symptoms. That will help it to move through cities and airports like an angel of death. . . That’s the salubrious thing about zoonotic diseases: They remind us, as St. Francis did, that we humans are inseparable from the natural world. In fact, there is no “natural world,” it’s a bad and artificial phrase. There is only the world. Humankind is part of that world, as are the ebolaviruses, as are the influenzas and the HIVs, as are Nipah and Hendra and SARS, as are chimpanzees and bats and palm civets and bar-headed geese, as is the next murderous virus—the one we haven’t yet detected. . . individual effort, individual discernment, individual choice can have huge effects in averting the catastrophes that might otherwise sweep through a herd. . .",

Publisher’s Description: “Shay was still angry but shrugged nonchalantly as if to say, it’s not that big of a deal. “So, what am I wrong about?” “You’re not going to want to hear this, but I have to tell you anyway.” Liam paused before finishing. “You might be working hard, but you’re not doing it for the company.” “What the hell does that mean?” Shay wanted to know. Knowing that his adversary might punch him for what he was about to say, Liam responded. “You’re doing it for yourself.” New York Times best-selling author Patrick Lencioni has written a dozen books that focus on how leaders can build teams and lead organizations. In The Motive, he shifts his attention toward helping them understand the importance of why they’re leading in the first place. In what may be his edgiest page-turner to date, Lencioni thrusts his readers into a day-long conversation between rival CEOs. Shay Davis is the CEO of Golden Gate Alarm, who, after just a year in his role, is beginning to worry about his job and is desperate to figure out how to turn things around. With nowhere else to turn, Shay receives some hard-to-swallow advice from the most unlikely and unwanted source—Liam Alcott, CEO of a more successful security company and his most hated opponent. Lencioni uses unexpected plot twists and crisp dialogue to take us on a journey that culminates in a resolution that is as unexpected as it is enlightening. As he does in his other books, he then provides a straightforward summary of the lessons from the fable, combining a clear explanation of his theory with practical advice to help executives examine their true motivation for leading. In addition to provoking readers to honestly assess themselves, Lencioni presents action steps for changing their approach in five key areas. In doing so, he helps leaders avoid the pitfalls that stifle their organizations and even hurt the people they are meant to serve.” .",

Publisher’s Description: “The vast amounts of ontologically unstructured information on the Web, including HTML, XML and JSON documents, natural language documents, tweets, blogs, markups, and even structured documents like CSV tables, all contain useful knowledge that can present a tremendous advantage to the Artificial Intelligence community if extracted robustly, efficiently and semi- automatically as knowledge graphs. Domain-specific Knowledge Graph Construction (KGC) is an active research area that has recently witnessed impressive advances due to machine learning techniques like deep neural networks and word embeddings. This book will synthesize Knowledge Graph Construction over Web Data in an engaging and accessible manner. The book will describe a timely topic for both early -and mid-career researchers. Every year, more papers continue to be published on knowledge graph construction, especially for difficult Web domains. This work would serve as a useful reference, as well as an accessible but rigorous overview of this body of work. The book will present interdisciplinary connections when possible to engage researchers looking for new ideas or synergies. This will allow the book to be marketed in multiple venues and conferences. The book will also appeal to practitioners in industry and data scientists since it will have chapters on both data collection, as well as a chapter on querying and off-the-shelf implementations. The author has, and continues to, present on this topic at large and important conferences. He plans to make the powerpoint he presents available as a supplement to the work. This will draw a natural audience for the book. Some of the reviewers are unsure about his position in the community but that seems to be more a function of his age rather than his relative expertise. I agree with some of the reviewers that the title is a little complicated. I would recommend “Domain Specific Knowledge Graphs”.” .",

Publisher’s Description: “Shares counterintuitive advice on the most effective path to success in any domain while revealing the essential contributions of generalist, not specialist, team members” . Quotes . Eventual elites typically devote less time early on to deliberate practice in the activity in which they will eventually become experts. Instead, they undergo what researchers call a “sampling period.” They play a variety of sports, usually in an unstructured or lightly structured environment; they gain a range of physical proficiencies from which they can draw; they learn about their own abilities and proclivities; and only later do they focus in and ramp up technical practice in one area. . . I dove into work showing that highly credentialed experts can become so narrow-minded that they actually get worse with experience, even while becoming more confident—a dangerous combination. And I was stunned when cognitive psychologists I spoke with led me to an enormous and too often ignored body of work demonstrating that learning itself is best done slowly to accumulate lasting knowledge, even when that means performing poorly on tests of immediate progress. That is, the most effective learning looks inefficient; it looks like falling behind. . . increasing specialization has created a “system of parallel trenches” in the quest for innovation. Everyone is digging deeper into their own trench and rarely standing up to look in the next trench over, even though the solution to their problem happens to reside there. . . The challenge we all face is how to maintain the benefits of breadth, diverse experience, interdisciplinary thinking, and delayed concentration in a world that increasingly incentivizes, even demands, hyperspecialization. . . The bestseller Talent Is Overrated used the Polgar sisters and Tiger Woods as proof that a head start in deliberate practice is the key to success in “virtually any activity that matters to you.” The powerful lesson is that anything in the world can be conquered in the same way. It relies on one very important, and very unspoken, assumption: that chess and golf are representative examples of all the activities that matter to you. . . It was a wide-ranging review of research that rocked psychology because it showed experience simply did not create skill in a wide range of real-world scenarios, from college administrators assessing student potential to psychiatrists predicting patient performance to human resources professionals deciding who will succeed in job training. In those domains, which involved human behavior and where patterns did not clearly repeat, repetition did not cause learning. Chess, golf, and firefighting are exceptions, not the rule. . . In 2009, Kahneman and Klein took the unusual step of coauthoring a paper in which they laid out their views and sought common ground. And they found it. Whether or not experience inevitably led to expertise, they agreed, depended entirely on the domain in question. Narrow experience made for better chess and poker players and firefighters, but not for better predictors of financial or political trends, or of how employees or patients would perform. . . The domains Klein studied, in which instinctive pattern recognition worked powerfully, are what psychologist Robin Hogarth termed “kind” learning environments. Patterns repeat over and over, and feedback is extremely accurate and usually very rapid. In golf or chess, a ball or piece is moved according to rules and within defined boundaries, a consequence is quickly apparent, and similar challenges occur repeatedly. . . Kahneman was focused on the flip side of kind learning environments; Hogarth called them “wicked.” In wicked domains, the rules of the game are often unclear or incomplete, there may or may not be repetitive patterns and they may not be obvious, and feedback is often delayed, inaccurate, or both. . . Our greatest strength is the exact opposite of narrow specialization. It is the ability to integrate broadly. . . “AI systems are like savants.” They need stable structures and narrow worlds. . . When narrow specialization is combined with an unkind domain, the human tendency to rely on experience of familiar patterns can backfire horribly—like the expert firefighters who suddenly make poor choices when faced with a fire in an unfamiliar structure. . . All this is bad news for some of the business world’s favorite successful-learning analogies—the Polgars, Tiger, and to some degree analogies based in any sport or game. Compared to golf, a sport like tennis is much more dynamic, with players adjusting to opponents every second, to surfaces, and sometimes to their own teammates. (Federer was a 2008 Olympic gold medalist in doubles.) But tennis is still very much on the kind end of the spectrum compared to, say, a hospital emergency room, where doctors and nurses do not automatically find out what happens to a patient after their encounter. They have to find ways to learn beyond practice, and to assimilate lessons that might even contradict their direct experience. The world is not golf, and most of it isn’t even tennis. As Robin Hogarth put it, much of the world is “Martian tennis.” You can see the players on a court with balls and rackets, but nobody has shared the rules. It is up to you to derive them, and they are subject to change without notice. . . The main conclusion of work that took years of studying scientists and engineers, all of whom were regarded by peers as true technical experts, was that those who did not make a creative contribution to their field lacked aesthetic interests outside their narrow area. As psychologist and prominent creativity researcher Dean Keith Simonton observed, “rather than obsessively focus[ing] on a narrow topic,” creative achievers tend to have broad interests. “This breadth often supports insights that cannot be attributed to domain-specific expertise alone.” . . Connolly’s primary finding was that early in their careers, those who later made successful transitions had broader training and kept multiple “career streams” open even as they pursued a primary specialty. They “traveled on an eight-lane highway,” he wrote, rather than down a single-lane one-way street. They had range. The successful adapters were excellent at taking knowledge from one pursuit and applying it creatively to another, and at avoiding cognitive entrenchment. They employed what Hogarth called a “circuit breaker.” They drew on outside experiences and analogies to interrupt their inclination toward a previous solution that may no longer work. Their skill was in avoiding the same old patterns. In the wicked world, with ill-defined challenges and few rigid rules, range can be a life hack. . . In Flynn’s terms, we now see the world through “scientific spectacles.” He means that rather than relying on our own direct experiences, we make sense of reality through classification schemes, using layers of abstract concepts to understand how pieces of information relate to one another. . . Research on thousands of adults in six industrializing nations found that exposure to modern work with self-directed problem solving and nonrepetitive challenges was correlated with being “cognitively flexible.” . . that modern life requires range, making connections across far-flung domains and ideas. Luria addressed this kind of “categorical” thinking, which Flynn would later style as scientific spectacles. “[It] is usually quite flexible,” Luria wrote. “Subjects readily shift from one attribute to another and construct suitable categories. They classify objects by substance (animals, flowers, tools), materials (wood, metal, glass), size (large, small), and color (light, dark), or other property. The ability to move freely, to shift from one category to another, is one of the chief characteristics of ‘abstract thinking.’” . . Chicago has long prided itself on a core curriculum dedicated to interdisciplinary critical thinking. The two-year core, according to the university, “is intended as an introduction to the tools of inquiry used in every discipline—science, mathematics, humanities, and social sciences. The goal is not just to transfer knowledge, but to raise fundamental questions and to become familiar with the powerful ideas that shape our society.” . . Jeannette Wing, a computer science professor at Columbia University and former corporate vice president of Microsoft Research, has pushed broad “computational thinking” as the mental Swiss Army knife. She advocated that it become as fundamental as reading, even for those who will have nothing to do with computer science or programming. “Computational thinking is using abstraction and decomposition when attacking a large complex task,” she wrote. “It is choosing an appropriate representation for a problem.” . . Like chess masters and firefighters, premodern villagers relied on things being the same tomorrow as they were yesterday. They were extremely well prepared for what they had experienced before, and extremely poorly equipped for everything else. Their very thinking was highly specialized in a manner that the modern world has been telling us is increasingly obsolete. They were perfectly capable of learning from experience, but failed at learning without experience. And that is what a rapidly changing, wicked world demands—conceptual reasoning skills that can connect new ideas and work across contexts. Faced with any problem they had not directly experienced before, the remote villagers were completely lost. That is not an option for us. The more constrained and repetitive a challenge, the more likely it will be automated, while great rewards will accrue to those who can take conceptual knowledge from one problem or domain and apply it in an entirely new one. . . The psychologists highlighted the variety of paths to excellence, but the most common was a sampling period, often lightly structured with some lessons and a breadth of instruments and activities, followed only later by a narrowing of focus, increased structure, and an explosion of practice volume. . . But for learning that is both durable (it sticks) and flexible (it can be applied broadly), fast and easy is precisely the problem. . . Kornell was explaining the concept of “desirable difficulties,” obstacles that make learning more challenging, slower, and more frustrating in the short term, but better in the long term. . . Used for learning, testing, including self-testing, is a very desirable difficulty. Even testing prior to studying works, at the point when wrong answers are assured. . . another important desirable difficulty: “spacing,” or distributed practice. It is what it sounds like—leaving time between practice sessions for the same material. You might call it deliberate not-practicing between bouts of deliberate practice. . . In 2007, the U.S. Department of Education published a report by six scientists and an accomplished teacher who were asked to identify learning strategies that truly have scientific backing. Spacing, testing, and using making-connections questions were on the extremely short list. All three impair performance in the short term. . . Psychologist Robert Bjork first used the phrase “desirable difficulties” in 1994. Twenty years later, he and a coauthor concluded a book chapter on applying the science of learning like this: “Above all, the most basic message is that teachers and students must avoid interpreting current performance as learning. Good performance on a test during the learning process can indicate mastery, but learners and teachers need to be aware that such performance will often index, instead, fast but fleeting progress.” . . for knowledge to be flexible, it should be learned under varied conditions, an approach called varied or mixed practice, or, to researchers, “interleaving.” Interleaving has been shown to improve inductive reasoning. When presented with different examples mixed together, students learn to create abstract generalizations that allow them to apply what they learned to material they have never encountered before. . . Desirable difficulties like testing and spacing make knowledge stick. It becomes durable. Desirable difficulties like making connections and interleaving make knowledge flexible, useful for problems that never appeared in training. All slow down learning and make performance suffer, in the short term. . . Before-our-eyes progress reinforces our instinct to do more of the same, but just like the case of the typhoid doctor, the feedback teaches the wrong lesson. Learning deeply means learning slowly. The cult of the head start fails the learners it seeks to serve. Knowledge with enduring utility must be very flexible, composed of mental schemes that can be matched to new problems. . . When a knowledge structure is so flexible that it can be applied effectively even in new domains or extremely novel situations, it is called “far transfer.” . . “In my opinion,” Gentner told me, “our ability to think relationally is one of the reasons we’re running the planet. Relations are really hard for other species.” Analogical thinking takes the new and makes it familiar, or takes the familiar and puts it in a new light, and allows humans to reason through problems they have never seen in unfamiliar contexts. It also allows us to understand that which we cannot see at all. . . In a wicked world, relying upon experience from a single domain is not only limiting, it can be disastrous. . . The trouble with using no more than a single analogy, particularly one from a very similar situation, is that it does not help battle the natural impulse to employ the “inside view,” a term coined by psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky. We take the inside view when we make judgments based narrowly on the details of a particular project that are right in front of us. . . Our natural inclination to take the inside view can be defeated by following analogies to the “outside view.” The outside view probes for deep structural similarities to the current problem in different ones. The outside view is deeply counterintuitive because it requires a decision maker to ignore unique surface features of the current project, on which they are the expert, and instead look outside for structurally similar analogies. It requires a mindset switch from narrow to broad. . . Psychologists have shown repeatedly that the more internal details an individual can be made to consider, the more extreme their judgment becomes. . . In one of the most cited studies of expert problem solving ever conducted, an interdisciplinary team of scientists came to a pretty simple conclusion: successful problem solvers are more able to determine the deep structure of a problem before they proceed to match a strategy to it. Less successful problem solvers are more like most students in the Ambiguous Sorting Task: they mentally classify problems only by superficial, overtly stated features, like the domain context. For the best performers, they wrote, problem solving “begins with the typing of the problem.” As education pioneer John Dewey put it in Logic, The Theory of Inquiry, “a problem well put is half-solved.” . . In the late 1960s, future Nobel laureate economist Theodore Schultz argued that his field had done well to show that higher education increased worker productivity, but that economists had neglected the role of education in allowing individuals to delay specialization while sampling and finding out who they are and where they fit. . . Learning stuff was less important than learning about oneself. Exploration is not just a whimsical luxury of education; it is a central benefit. . . The expression “young and foolish,” he wrote, describes the tendency of young adults to gravitate to risky jobs, but it is not foolish at all. It is ideal. They have less experience than older workers, and so the first avenues they should try are those with high risk and reward, and that have high informational value. . .",

Publisher’s Description: “The definitive guide to statistical thinking Statistics are everywhere, as integral to science as they are to business, and in the popular media hundreds of times a day. In this age of big data, a basic grasp of statistical literacy is more important than ever if we want to separate the fact from the fiction, the ostentatious embellishments from the raw evidence – and even more so if we hope to participate in the future, rather than being simple bystanders. In The Art of Statistics, world- renowned statistician David Spiegelhalter shows readers how to derive knowledge from raw data by focusing on the concepts and connections behind the math. Drawing on real world examples to introduce complex issues, he shows us how statistics can help us determine the luckiest passenger on the Titanic, whether a notorious serial killer could have been caught earlier, and if screening for ovarian cancer is beneficial. The Art of Statistics not only shows us how mathematicians have used statistical science to solve these problems – it teaches us how we too can think like statisticians. We learn how to clarify our questions, assumptions, and expectations when approaching a problem, and – perhaps even more importantly – we learn how to responsibly interpret the answers we receive. Combining the incomparable insight of an expert with the playful enthusiasm of an aficionado, The Art of Statistics is the definitive guide to stats that every modern person needs.” . Notes . . Epistemic Uncertainty . epistemic uncertainty: lack of knowledge about facts, numbers or scientific hypotheses. . Aleatory Uncertainty . aleatory uncertainty: unavoidable unpredictability about the future, also known as chance, randomness, luck and so on. . P18 . Introduction . Turning experiences into data is not straightforward, and data is inevitably limited in its capacity to describe the world. . Statistical science has a long and successful history, but is now changing in the light of increased availability of data. . Skill in statistical methods plays an important part of being a data scientist. . Teaching statistics is changing from a focus on mathematical methods to one based on an entire problem-solving cycle. . The PPDAC cycle provides a convenient framework: Problem - Plan - Data - Analysis – Conclusion and communication. . Data literacy is a key skill for the modern world. . P38 . Getting Things In Proportion . Binary variables are yes/no questions, sets of which can be summarized as proportions. . Positive or negative framing of proportions can change their emotional impact. . Relative risks tend to convey an exaggerated importance, and absolute risks should be provided for clarity. . Expected frequencies promote understanding and an appropriate sense of importance. . Odds ratios arise from scientific studies but should not be used for general communication. . Graphics need to be chosen with care and awareness of their impact. . P72 . Summarizing and Communicating Numbers. Lots of Number . A variety of statistics can be used to summarize the empirical distribution of data-points, including measures of location and spread. . Skewed data distributions are common, and some summary statistics are very sensitive to outlying values. . Data summaries always hide some detail, and care is required so that important information is not lost. . Single sets of numbers can be visualized in strip- charts, box-and-whisker plots and histograms. . Consider transformations to better reveal patterns, and use the eye to detect patterns, outliers, similarities and clusters. . Look at pairs of numbers as scatter-plots, and time- series as line-graphs. . When exploring data, a primary aim is to find factors that explain the overall variation. . Graphics can be both interactive and animated. . Infographics highlight interesting features and can guide the viewer through a story, but should be used with awareness of their purpose and their impact. . P94 . Why Are We Looking At Data Anyway? Populations and Measurement . Inductive inference requires working from our data, through study sample and study population, to a target population. . Problems and biases can crop up at each stage of this path. . The best way to proceed from sample to study population is to have drawn a random sample. . A population can be thought of as a group of individuals, but also as providing the probability distribution for a random observation drawn from that population. . Populations can be summarized using parameters that mirror the summary statistics of sample data. . Often data does not arise as a sample from a literal population. When we have all the data there is, then we can imagine it drawn from a metaphorical population of events that could have occurred, but didn’t. . P119 . What Causes What? . Causation, in the statistical sense, means that when we intervene, the chances of different outcomes are systematically changed. . Causation is difficult to establish statistically, but well-designed randomized trials are the best available framework. . Principles of blinding, intention-to-treat and so on have enabled large-scale clinical trials to identify moderate but important effects. . Observational data may have background factors influencing the apparent observed relationships between an exposure and an outcome, which may be either observed confounders or lurking factors. . Statistical methods exist for adjusting for other factors, but judgement is always required as to the confidence with which causation can be claimed. . P141 . Modeling Relationships Using Regression . Regression models provide a mathematical representation between a set of explanatory variables and a response variable. . The coefficients in a regression model indicate how much we expect the response to change when the explanatory variable is observed to change. . Regression-to-the-mean occurs when more extreme responses revert to nearer the long-term average, since a contribution to their previous extremeness was pure chance. . Regression models can incorporate different types of response variable, explanatory variables and non- linear relationships. . Caution is required in interpreting models, which should not be taken too literally: ‘All models are wrong, but some are useful. . P187 . Algorithms, Analytics and Prediction . Algorithms built from data can be used for classification and prediction in technological applications . . It is important to guard against over-fitting an algorithm to training data , essentially fitting to noise rather than signal . Algorithms can be evaluated by the classification accuracy , their ability to discriminate between groups , and their overall predictive accuracy . Complex algorithms may lack transparency , and it may be worth trading off some accuracy for comprehension . The use of algorithms and artificial intelligence presents many challenges , and insights into both the power and limitations of machine-learning methods is vital . P204 . How Sure Can We Be About What Is Going On? Estimates and Intervals . Uncertainty intervals are an important part of communicating statistics. . Bootstrapping a sample consists of creating new data sets of the same size by resampling the original data, with replacement. . Sample statistics calculated from bootstrap re- samples tend towards a normal distribution for larger data sets, regardless of the shape of the original data distribution. . Uncertainty intervals based on bootstrapping take advantage of modern computer power, do not require assumptions about the mathematical form of the population and do not require complex probability theory. . P228 . Probability- the Language of Uncertainty and Variability . The theory of probability provides a formal language and mathematics for dealing with chance phenomena. . The implications of probability are not intuitive, but insights can be improved by using the idea of expected frequencies. . The ideas of probability are useful even when there is no explicit use of a randomizing mechanism. . Many social phenomena show a remarkable regularity in their overall pattern, while individual events are entirely unpredictable. . P252 . Putting Probability and Statistics Together . Probability theory can be used to derive the sampling distribution of summary statistics, from which formulae for confidence intervals can be derived. . A 95% confidence interval is the result of a procedure that, in 95% of cases in which its assumptions are correct, will contain the true parameter value. It cannot be claimed that a specific interval has 95% probability of containing the true value. . The Central Limit Theorem implies that sample means and other summary statistics can be assumed to have a normal distribution for large samples. . Margins of error usually do not incorporate systematic error due to non-random causes – external knowledge and judgement is required to assess these. . Confidence intervals can be calculated even when we observe all the data, which then represent uncertainty about the parameters of an underlying metaphorical population. . P304 . Answering Questions and Claiming Discoveries . Tests of null hypotheses - default assumptions about statistical models – form a major part of statistical practice. . A P-value is a measure of the incompatibility between the observed data and a null hypothesis: formally it is the probability of observing such an extreme result, were the null hypothesis true. . Traditionally, P-value thresholds of 0.05 and 0.01 have been set to declare ‘statistical significance’. . These thresholds need to be adjusted if multiple tests are conducted, for example on different subsets of the data or multiple outcome measures. . There is a precise correspondence between confidence intervals and P-values: if, say, the 95% interval excludes 0, we can reject the null hypothesis of 0 at P &lt; 0.05. . Neyman-Pearson theory specifies an alternative hypothesis, and fixes Type I and Type II error rates for the two possible kinds of errors in a hypothesis test. . Separate forms of hypothesis tests have been developed for sequential testing. . P-values are often misinterpreted: in particular they do not convey the probability that the null hypothesis is true, nor does a non-significant result imply that the null hypothesis is true. . P339 . Learning from Experience the Bayesian Way . Bayesian methods combine evidence from data (summarized by the likelihood) with initial beliefs (known as the prior distribution) to produce a posterior probability distribution for the unknown quantity. . Bayes’ theorem for two competing hypotheses can be expressed as posterior odds = likelihood ratio x prior odds. . The likelihood ratio expresses the relative support for two hypotheses from an item of evidence, and is sometimes used to summarize forensic evidence in criminal trials. . When the prior distribution comes from some physical sampling process, Bayesian methods are uncontroversial. However generally a degree of judgement is necessary. . Hierarchical models allow evidence to be pooled across multiple small analyses that are assumed to have parameters in common. . Bayes factors are the equivalent of likelihood ratios for scientific hypotheses, and are a controversial substitute for null-hypothesis significance testing. . The theory of statistical inference has a long history of controversy, but issues of quality of data and scientific reliability are more important. . P360 . How Things Go Wrong . Poor statistical practice has some responsibility for the crisis in the reproducibility of science. . Deliberate fabrication of data appears to be fairly rare, but errors in statistical methods are frequent. . An even greater problem is questionable research practices that tend to lead to exaggerated claims of statistical significance. . In the pipeline by which statistical evidence reaches the public, press offices, journalists and editors add to the flow of unjustified statistical claims through their use of questionable interpretation and communication practices. . P377 . How We Can Do Statistics Better . Producers, communicators and audiences all have a role in improving the way that statistical science is used in society. . Producers need to ensure that science is reproducible. To demonstrate trustworthiness, information should be accessible, intelligible, assessable and useable. . Communicators need to be wary of trying to fit statistical stories into standard narratives. . Audiences need to call out poor practice by asking questions about the trustworthiness of their numbers, their source and their interpretation. . When faced with a claim based on statistical evidence, first feel whether it seems plausible. . P379 . Rules for Effective Statistical Practice . Statistical methods should enable data to answer scientific questions: Ask ‘why am I doing this?’, rather than focusing on which particular technique to use. . | Signals always come with noise: It is trying to separate out the two that makes the subject interesting. Variability is inevitable, and probability models are useful as an abstraction. . | Plan ahead, really ahead: This includes the idea of pre- specification in confirmatory experiments - avoiding researcher degrees of freedom. . | Worry about data quality: Everything rests on the data. . | Statistical analysis is more than a set of computations: Do not just plug into formulae or run procedures in software, without knowing why you are doing so. . | Keep it simple: The main communication should be as basic as possible - do not show off skills in complex modelling unless they are really necessary. . | Provide assessments of variability: With the warning that margins of error are generally bigger than claimed. . | Check your assumptions: And make clear when this has not been possible. . | When possible, replicate!: Or encourage others to do so. . | Make your analysis reproducible: Others should be able to access your data and code. . |",

            "content": ". The Undoing Project by Michael Lewis . isbn-13: 9780393354775 . Audible . “Forty years ago, Israeli psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky wrote a series of breathtakingly original studies undoing our assumptions about the decision-making process. Their papers showed the ways in which the human mind erred, systematically, when forced to make judgments in uncertain situations. Their work created the field of behavioral economics, revolutionized Big Data studies, advanced evidence-based medicine, led to a new approach to government regulation, and made much of Michael Lewis’s own work possible. Kahneman and Tversky are more responsible than anybody for the powerful trend to mistrust human intuition and defer to algorithms. The Undoing Project is about a compelling collaboration between two men who have the dimensions of great literary figures. They became heroes in the university and on the battlefield–both had important careers in the Israeli military–and their research was deeply linked to their extraordinary life experiences. Amos Tversky was a brilliant, self- confident warrior and extrovert, the center of rapt attention in any room; Kahneman, a fugitive from the Nazis in his childhood, was an introvert whose questing self-doubt was the seedbed of his ideas. They became one of the greatest partnerships in the history of science, working together so closely that they couldn’t remember whose brain originated which ideas, or who should claim credit. They flipped a coin to decide the lead authorship on the first paper they wrote, and simply alternated thereafter. This story about the workings of the human mind is explored through the personalities of two fascinating individuals so fundamentally different from each other that they seem unlikely friends or colleagues. In the process they may well have changed, for good, mankind’s view of its own mind.” .",

            "title": "What I read in 2019",
            "content": "I managed to read 36 books in 2019 - slightly off my target of 40, but not bad considering extenuating circumstances. For full disclosure, the total of 36 does include 5 ‘Audible Originals’ that are shorter than a typical book - and in some cases, a bit of a stretch to be called a book. On the other hand the longest book I ‘read’ - Cryptonomicon - was a whopping 1,139 pages / 42 hrs and 44 minutes listening time! The vast majority were audiobooks, but I have started reading physical books again rather than just e-books. . Favorite non-fiction books that I read in 2019: The Half Has Never Been Told by Edward R. Baptist was an eye-opening account of slavery in the period between Independence and the Civil War. He shows in detail how capitalism and profit drove the slave trade, the systematic torture that produced ever increasing cotton yields and how US and European banks created financial instruments with slaves as the underlying collateral. . Educated by Tara Westover deservedly made a lot of ‘Best of 2018’ book lists. It is a gripping and at times difficult-to-read memoir of a girl growing up in a survivalist Mormon family. Difficult because many of her experiences growing up are so harrowing. How she went from being (barely) home-schooled on an Idaho mountain-side to studying in Cambridge and Harvard is worth every minute you spend reading it. . I loved Algorithms to Live By by Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths, especially as a software developer who studied Electrical Engineering rather than Computer Science and have never really got the grounding in Algorithms that CS majors have. This is in no way a dry text book but an enjoyable tour through different categories of algorithms and how they have relevance in every day life outside of a computer program. . Thinking in Systems: A Primer by Donnella Meadows was originally published in 2008 and was a Farnam Street blog recommendation. It’s starts off with the basics of systems’ modelling and feedback mechanisms. Again not a textbook, but an easy to read introduction to systems analysis and how to apply to it to real-world problems. Even though modeling feedback control systems was something I had done back in university, I still found this a valuable read. . Rebooting AI by Gary Marcus and Ernest Davis is a useful counterbalance to the current hyperbole around AI. The authors make a convincing argument that current machine learning methods, including deep learning, are not sufficient to achieve anything like true Artificial General Intelligence. What’s not so clear is what, if anything, will get us there - the authors argue for a renewed focus on understanding human cognition with a hybrid of current machine learning with symbolic inference based on knowledge-bases being the way forward. . I approached Malcom Gladwell’s Talking To Strangers with some trepidation. He is a great storyteller and his books are always a pleasure to read, but the premise or theory underlying some of his previous books (e.g. Blink or Outliers) has often turned out to be somewhat flawed. His latest book doesn’t seem to have a (to my mind at least) controversial underlying theory, so hopefully will stand the test of time better. As an aside, this book seems to be an exception to the general rule that authors shouldn’t narrate their own books and in fact makes great use of the audiobook format, using actual recordings of interviews wherever possible. . Michael Lewis is another great storyteller, and when I finally got around to listening to The Undoing Project I wasn’t disappointed. Maybe I’ll make another attempt at finishing Daniel Kahneman’s Thinking, Fast and Slow in 2020! . Favorite fiction books that I read in 2019: In non-fiction, I really liked Recursion by Blake Crouch - I’m a sucker for anything time-travel related and this story was very well done I thought. I discovered Dervla McTiernan and her detective novels, The Ruin and The Scholar set in my hometown of Galway - she’s no Tana French, but writing is decent enough and the setting makes them compelling, at least for me. Continuing the Irish theme, A Keeper and Holding by Graham Norton were enjoyable. The premise of Redshirts by John Scalzi was very clever and enough to keep me interested through some strangely stilted language. I recommend Righteous and Wrecked by Joe Ide for fans of detective novels and, of course, Michael Connelly (The Night Fire) never fails to please . In it’s own category… I guess that strictly speaking it’s in the fiction category, but The Unicorn Project by Gene Kim is a compelling read for anyone working in software development, especially in an enterprise environment. The follow-up to the brilliant The Phoenix Project, the Unicorn Project is actually set during the same period as the earlier book and gives the Dev side of the DevOps, whereas the Phoenix Project’s viewpoint was more the Ops side. .

Hardcover . “Two leaders in the field offer a compelling analysis of the current state of the art and reveal the steps we must take to achieve a truly robust artificial intelligence. Despite the hype surrounding AI, creating an intelligence that rivals or exceeds human levels is far more complicated than we have been led to believe. Professors Gary Marcus and Ernest Davis have spent their careers at the forefront of AI research and have witnessed some of the greatest milestones in the field, but they argue that a computer beating a human in Jeopardy! does not signal that we are on the doorstep of fully autonomous cars or superintelligent machines. The achievements in the field thus far have occurred in closed systems with fixed sets of rules, and these approaches are too narrow to achieve genuine intelligence. The real world, in contrast, is wildly complex and open- ended. How can we bridge this gap? What will the consequences be when we do? Taking inspiration from the human mind, Marcus and Davis explain what we need to advance AI to the next level, and suggest that if we are wise along the way, we won’t need to worry about a future of machine overlords. If we focus on endowing machines with common sense and deep understanding, rather than simply focusing on statistical analysis and gathering ever larger collections of data, we will be able to create an AI we can trust– in our homes, our cars, and our doctors’ offices. Rebooting AI provides a lucid, clear-eyed assessment of the current science and offers an inspiring vision of how a new generation of AI can make our lives better.” .",

Darcy Therapeutics has a finger in every pie, from sponsoring university research facilities to funding political parties to philanthropy –it has even funded Emma’s own ground-breaking research. As the murder investigation twists in unexpected ways and Cormac’s running of the case comes under scrutiny from the department and his colleagues, he is forced to question himself and the beliefs that he has long held as truths.

The media loves to report on millions, billions, and trillions, but frequently makes basic mistakes or presents such numbers in misleading ways. And misunderstanding numbers can have serious consequences, since they can deceive us in many of our most important decisions, including how to vote, what to buy, and whether to make a financial investment. In this short, accessible, enlightening, and entertaining book, leading computer scientist Brian Kernighan teaches anyone—even diehard math-phobes—how to demystify the numbers that assault us every day. With examples drawn from a rich variety of sources, including journalism, advertising, and politics, Kernighan demonstrates how numbers can mislead and misrepresent. In chapters covering big numbers, units, dimensions, and more, he lays bare everything from deceptive graphs to speciously precise numbers. And he shows how anyone—using a few basic ideas and lots of shortcuts—can easily learn to recognize common mistakes, determine whether numbers are credible, and make their own sensible estimates when needed. Giving you the simple tools you need to avoid being fooled by dubious numbers, Millions, Billions, Zillions is an essential survival guide for a world drowning in big—and often bad—data.” .",

How did Fidel Castro fool the CIA for a generation? Why did Neville Chamberlain think he could trust Adolf Hitler? Why are campus sexual assaults on the rise? Do television sitcoms teach us something about the way we relate to each other that isn’t true? Talking to Strangers is a classically Gladwellian intellectual adventure, a challenging and controversial excursion through history, psychology, and scandals taken straight from the news. He revisits the deceptions of Bernie Madoff, the trial of Amanda Knox, the suicide of Sylvia Plath, the Jerry Sandusky pedophilia scandal at Penn State University, and the death of Sandra Bland—throwing our understanding of these and other stories into doubt. Something is very wrong, Gladwell argues, with the tools and strategies we use to make sense of people we don’t know. And because we don’t know how to talk to strangers, we are inviting conflict and misunderstanding in ways that have a profound effect on our lives and our world. In his first book since his #1 bestseller, David and Goliath, Malcolm Gladwell has written a gripping guidebook for troubled times.” .",

Kindle . “In the years following her role as the lead author of the international bestseller, Limits to Growth—the first book to show the consequences of unchecked growth on a finite planet— Donella Meadows remained a pioneer of environmental and social analysis until her untimely death in 2001. Meadows’ newly released manuscript, Thinking in Systems, is a concise and crucial book offering insight for problem solving on scales ranging from the personal to the global. Edited by the Sustainability Institute’s Diana Wright, this essential primer brings systems thinking out of the realm of computers and equations and into the tangible world, showing readers how to develop the systems-thinking skills that thought leaders across the globe consider critical for 21st-century life. Some of the biggest problems facing the world—war, hunger, poverty, and environmental degradation—are essentially system failures. They cannot be solved by fixing one piece in isolation from the others, because even seemingly minor details have enormous power to undermine the best efforts of too-narrow thinking. While readers will learn the conceptual tools and methods of systems thinking, the heart of the book is grander than methodology. Donella Meadows was known as much for nurturing positive outcomes as she was for delving into the science behind global dilemmas. She reminds readers to pay attention to what is important, not just what is quantifiable, to stay humble, and to stay a learner. In a world growing ever more complicated, crowded, and interdependent, Thinking in Systems helps readers avoid confusion and helplessness, the first step toward finding proactive and effective solutions.” .",

When Elizabeth Keane returns to Ireland after her mother’s death, she’s focused only on saying goodbye to that dark and dismal part of her life. Her childhood home is packed solid with useless junk, her mother’s presence already fading. But within this mess, she discovers a small stash of letters—and ultimately, the truth. Forty years earlier, a young woman stumbles from a remote stone house, the night quiet except for the constant wind that encircles her as she hurries deeper into the darkness away from the cliffs and the sea. She has no sense of where she is going, only that she must keep on. With wistful and evocative prose, A Keeper is sure to appeal to “fans of sensitive character studies” (Publishers Weekly) and brilliantly illustrates Graham Norton’s clear-eyed understanding of human nature and its darkest flaws.” .",

Audible . “With this extraordinary first volume in what promises to be an epoch-making masterpiece, Neal Stephenson hacks into the secret histories of nations and the private obsessions of men, decrypting with dazzling virtuosity the forces that shaped this century. In 1942, Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse - mathematical genius and young Captain in the U.S. Navy - is assigned to detachment 2702. It is an outfit so secret that only a handful of people know it exists, and some of those people have names like Churchill and Roosevelt. The mission of Watrehouse and Detatchment 2702-commanded by Marine Raider Bobby Shaftoe-is to keep the Nazis ignorant of the fact that Allied Intelligence has cracked the enemy’s fabled Enigma code. It is a game, a cryptographic chess match between Waterhouse and his German counterpart, translated into action by the gung-ho Shaftoe and his forces. Fast-forward to the present, where Waterhouse’s crypto-hacker grandson, Randy, is attempting to create a “data haven” in Southeast Asia - a place where encrypted data can be stored and exchanged free of repression and scrutiny. As governments and multinationals attack the endeavor, Randy joins forces with Shaftoe’s tough-as-nails grandaughter, Amy, to secretly salvage a sunken Nazi sumarine that holds the key to keeping the dream of a data haven afloat. But soon their scheme brings to light a massive conspiracy with its roots in Detachment 2702 linked to an unbreakable Nazi code called Arethusa. And it will represent the path to unimaginable riches and a future of personal and digital liberty…or to universal totalitarianism reborn. A breathtaking tour de force, and Neal Stephenson’s most accomplished and affecting work to date, CRYPTONOMICON is profound and prophetic, hypnotic and hyper-driven, as it leaps forward and back between World War II and the World Wide Web, hinting all the while at a dark day- after-tomorrow. It is a work of great art, thought, and creative daring; the product of a truly icon” .",

Before Tyrion Lannister and Podrick Payne, there was Dunk and Egg. A young, naïve but ultimately courageous hedge knight, Ser Duncan the Tall towers above his rivals–in stature if not experience. Tagging along is his diminutive squire, a boy called Egg–whose true name is hidden from all he and Dunk encounter. Though more improbable heroes may not be found in all of Westeros, great destinies lay ahead for these two . . . as do powerful foes, royal intrigue, and outrageous exploits.

What should we do, or leave undone, in a day or a lifetime? How much messiness should we accept? What balance of new activities and familiar favorites is the most fulfilling? These may seem like uniquely human quandaries, but they are not: computers, too, face the same constraints, so computer scientists have been grappling with their version of such issues for decades. And the solutions they’ve found have much to teach us. In a dazzlingly interdisciplinary work, acclaimed author Brian Christian and cognitive scientist Tom Griffiths show how the algorithms used by computers can also untangle very human questions. They explain how to have better hunches and when to leave things to chance, how to deal with overwhelming choices and how best to connect with others. From finding a spouse to finding a parking spot, from organizing one’s inbox to understanding the workings of memory, Algorithms to Live By transforms the wisdom of computer science into strategies for human living.” .",

Dodson, once his sidekick, is now his full- fledged partner, hell-bent on giving IQ’s PI business some real legitimacy: a Facebook page, and IQ’s promise to stop accepting Christmas sweaters and carpet cleanings in exchange for PI services.

When a joint FBI-Seattle Police investigation of an international child pornography ring gets too close to certain powerful people, sex-crimes detective Livia Lone becomes the target of a hit that barely goes awry–a hit that had been offered to John Rain, a retired specialist in killings appearing to be from “natural causes.” Suspecting that the FBI themselves were behind the attack, Livia reaches out to former marine sniper Dox. Together, they assemble an ad hoc team to identify and neutralize the threat: Rain; Rain’s estranged lover, Mossad agent and honey-trap specialist Delilah; black op soldiers Ben Treven and Daniel Larison; and their former commander, SpecOps legend Colonel Scott “Hort” Horton. Moving from Japan to Seattle to DC to Paris, the group fights a series of interlocking conspiracies, each edging closer and closer to the highest levels of the US government. With uncertain loyalties, conflicting agendas, and smoldering romantic entanglements, this group is hardly a team. But in a match as uneven as this one, a collective of killers might be just what they need.” .",

One of my favourite authors, Michael Connelly brings together his veteran character Harry Bosch with LAPD detective Renee Ballard, Connelly’s latest creation. If you’re a fan of Connelly then this book will not disappoint - Ballard and Bosch work well together and it seems we will probably see a few more books where they team up. At this point though perhaps I’m too familiar with the pattern of Connelly’s writing - as soon as the character that turned out to be the villain was introduced, it was easy to guess that he was not just a sideshow but would reappear later in the novel. .",

            "content": ". Mistakes Were Made (But Not by Me) by Carol Tavris, Elliot Aronson . Kindle . This was a truly eye-opening deep dive into cognitive dissonance theory and its by-product self-justification. Although I was generally familiar with the term ‘cognitive dissonance’ I had not been exposed to cognitive dissonance theory in any detail. Having read this book, the world we live in today and, in particular, the fact that so many people hold beliefs that seem completely contradictory to clear facts, is much more understandable. . Cognitive dissonance is a state of tension that occurs whenever a person holds two cognitions (ideas, attitudes, beliefs, opinions) that are psychologically inconsistent, such as “Smoking is a dumb thing to do because it could kill me” and “I smoke two packs a day.” | Dissonance produces mental discomfort, ranging from minor pangs to deep anguish; people don’t rest easy until they find a way to reduce it. | Self-justification is the usual mechanism by which people reduce dissonance. People become more certain about something they just did if they can’t undo it or if it came at some cost (time, money, effort etc). Information that is consonant with their belief / decision is accepted and conflicting information is considered biased. | . The first few chapters discuss the pyschology and scientific behaviour and how the brain and memory works. The rest of the book dives into specific examples of how self-justification manifests itself. The chapters on false memory and innocent people convicted of crimes are particularly powerful. . A by-product of reading this book (at elast for me) is that it makes you examine your own deeply-held beliefs and look for evidence of self-justification. The challenge is that we are often blind to the lies we tell and have told ourselves so that self-justification may be very difficult to perceive. .",

After you’ve read a few of her books you’ll know that her protagonists are always changed in some fundamental way by the end, broken along some dimension of their being. You don’t want to be a primary character in one of her novels. . The Witch Elm is somewhat different than her previous Dublin Murder Squad novels in that the narrative isnt described through the eyes of the police investigating the crime but instead through the eyes of the victim. It’s still great and her writing is (as always) breathtaking at times. Unlike, say, Michael Connelly or JK Rowling, she isnt primarily a storyteller but someone who creates scenes and tensions that envelope you. .

A fairly short book, published in 1992, by George Leonard, an Aikido trainer that grew out an article he wrote for Esquire Magazine in 1987. I came across a recommendation for this book and thought I’d check it and am glad I did. It’s not a life-changing book but interesting and full of good advice. . Leonard defines mastery as “the mysterious process during which what is at first difficult becomes progressively easier and more pleasurable through practice”. There is a mastery curve which has relatively brief spurts of progress, each of which is followed by a slight decline to a plateau somewhat higher than that which preceded it. The mastery journey is one in which you must learn to love the plateau. . Leonard describes three character types: . The Dabbler who loves the initial spurt of progress when attempting something new but cannot handle being on the plateau so instead quickly moves to something else. | The Obsessive is a driven bottom-line type of person. He also cannot handle the plateau but instead of moving to something else like the Dabbler, he doubles-down - he doesn’t understand the necessity for periods of development on the plateau. He insists on continuous upward progress but instead crashes when ultimately he cant make it happen. | The Hacker, after getting the hang of something, is happy to stay on the plateau and doesnt seek any further improvement. | . Those on the path to mastery work hard while on the plateau but at the same time learn to love just being there and taking pleasure from working on the platau. Goals and contingencies are important but the exist in the future and the past. Practice, the path of mastery, exists only in the present. . The Five Master Keys: . Instruction | Practice | Surrender: Surrendering to your teacher and to the demands of your discipline. | Intentionality | The Edge: Take risks for the sake of higher performance. | . Quotes . “…the essence of boredom is to be found in the obsessive search for novelty. Satisfaction lies in mindful repetition, the discovery of endless richness in subtle variations on familiar themes.” | “In the woords of the ancient Eastern adage: ‘Before enlightenment, chop wood and carry water. After enlightenment, chop wood and carry water’” | “To be a learner, you’ve got to be willing to be a fool” | .",

We need to assess the quality of the decision using the a-priori information available at the time rather than the after-the-fact result. .

III. “Work Principles” details the principles that govern how Bridgewater Associates works as an idea meritocracy that tries to deliver meaningful work and relationships through radical truth and radical transparency. . It’s refreshing to see someone lay out the blueprint of their thinking in such a systematic way. The principles that Dalio lays out are definitely thought-provoking.

A summary of the principles is giving below: . “Think for yourself to decide 1) what you want, 2) what is true, and 3) what you should do to achieve #1 in light of #2, and do that with humility and open-mindedness so that you consider the best thinking that is available to you.” .

The book gave an interesting non-technical introduction to Critical State Theory and how it can be used to explain phenomena as diverse as earthquakes, forest fires, extinction events, financial markets and wars. Focusing initially on earthquakes, the book explains how scientists have singularly failed to come up with a theory that can predict when and where a major earhtquake will occur. Instead, scientists have found that earthquakes in general follow a power-law that describes how earthquake magnitude relates to frequency - the larger the earthquake, the less likely it is to occur. However, any size of earhquake can occur at any given time. How I understood it, is that complex systems with many interacting elements behave in a highly-path dependent manner and can build up to a critical state where a small ‘nudge’ can cause a very large change in the overall behavior, but could also just precipitate a very small change. . This book definitely left me looking at the world in a different way. The concepts have many potential repercussions to how we see the world and how we interact with it.

            "content": ". Blockchain Basics: A Non-Technical Introduction in 25 Steps by Daniel Drescher . ePub [Apress] . I haven’t read a large number of Blockchain to be able to compare this with others, but I was looking for an introduction that didn’t immediately dive into code or waffle-on at length about the how the technology will transform life as we know it. This book fit the bill pretty well. . The book consists of 25 steps, grouped into 5 major stages, that all together form a learning pathm which incrementally builds the reader’s knowledge of the blockchain. . Stage 1: Terminology and Technical Foundations . Step 1: Thinking in layers and aspects . Systems can be partioned into application vs implementation and functional vs non-functional aspects. | Integrity is a major non-functional aspect, and has three major components: Data Integrity | Behavioural Integrity | Security | . | Most software failures are the result of violated system integrity. | . Step 2: Software Architecture and it’s relation to the Blockchain . Software architectures can be centralized or distributed. | The blockchain is part of the implementation of a distributed software system* | The purpose of the blockchain is to achieve and maintain the integrity of a distributed software system | . Step 3: Recognizing the potential of peer-to-peer systems . Peer-to-peer systems are a specific type of distributed system that allow direct interactions between contractual partners rather than indirect interactions through a middleman. | . Stage 2: Why the Blockchain is needed . Step 4: Discovering the core problem . Integrity and trust are major concerns of peer-to-peer (P2P) systems | Major integrity threats in P2P systems are: Technical failures | Malicious peers | . | The blockchain addresses integrity of a purely distributed P2P system comprised of an unknown number of peers with unknown reliability and trustworthiness. | . Step 5: Disambiguating the term - 4 ways to define the blockchain . The term blockchain can be used as: a name for a data-structure: data in units called blocks, connected together like a chain. | a name for an algorithm: the sequence of intructions that negotiated the information content of many blockchain-data-structured in a P2P system. | a name for a suite of technologies: a combination of blockchain data-structure, algorithm and cryptographic and security technlogies that together achieve integrity in a P2P system. | an umbrella term for purely distributed P2P systems with a common application area | . | Managing ans clarifying ownership is the most prominent application of the blockchain, but not the only one. | The blockchain is a purely distributed peer-to-peer system of ledgers that utilizes a software unit that consist of an algorithm, which negotiates the informational content of ordered and connected blocks of data together with cryptographic and security technologies in order to achieve and maintain its integrity. | . Step 6: Understanding the nature of ownership . Proof of ownership has 3 elements: Identification of the owner | Identification of the object being owned | Mapping the owner to the object | . | Mapping between owners and object can be maintained in a ledger. | Having one ledger is risky as it can be damaged, destroyed or forged. | Can utilize a group of independent ledgers and define ownership based in that version of reality on which the majority of ledgers agree. | The blockchain algorith is responsible for letting individual nodes in a blockchain collectively arrive at one consitent version of the state of ownership. | Cryptography is used to ensure identity, authentication and authorization. | Integrity in a distributed P2P system of ledgers is found in it’s ability to make true statements about ownership and to ensure only the owner can transfer their property rights to others. | . Step 7: Spending Money Twice - Examining a vulnerability of distributed P2P systems . Double-spending can be seen as a problem of maintaining data consistency in distributed P2P systems. | The blockchain is a means to solving the double spending problem | . Stage 3: How the Blockchain works . Step 8: Planning the blockchain . The following tasks are necessary to design a distributed P2P system of ledgers for managing ownership: Describing ownership | Protecting ownership from unauthorized access | Storing transaction data | Preparing ledgers to be distributed in an untrustworthy environment | Distributing the ledgers | Adding and verifying new transactions to the ledgers | Deciding which ledgers represent the truth | . | . Step 9: Documenting Ownership . Transaction data provide the following information for describing a transfer of ownership: An identifier of the account who initiates the transaction and is to transfer ownership to another account | An identifier of that account that is to receive ownership | The amount of the goods to be transferred | The time the transaction is to be done | A fee to be paid to the system for executing the transaction | A proof that the owner of the account who hands off ownership agrees with that transfer | . | The complete history of transaction data is an audit trail that provides evidence of how people acquired and handed off ownership. | Any transaction not being part of that history is regarded as if it never happened. | A transaction is executed by adding it to the history of transaction data and allowing it to influence the result of aggregating them. | The order in which transaction data are added to the history must be preserved in order to yield identical results when aggregating these data. | In order to maintain integrity, only those transaction data are added to the blockchain-data-structure that fulfill the following three criteria: Formal correctness | Semantic correctness | Authorization | . | . Step 10: Hashing Data . Hash functions transform any kind of data into a number of fixed length, regardless of the size of the input data. | There are many different hash functions that differ among others with respect to the length of the hash value they produce. | Cryptographic hash functions are an important group of hash functions that create digital fingerprints for any kind of data. | Cryptographic hash functions exhibit the following properties: Provide hash values for any kind of data quickly | Deterministic | Pseudorandom | One-way usage | Collision resistant | . | Application of hash functions to data can be accomplished by using the following patterns: Repeated hashing | Independent hashing | Combined hashing | Sequential hashing | Hierarchical hashing | . | . Step 11: Hashing in the real world . Hash values can be used: To compare data | To detect whether data that were supposed to stay unchanged have been altered | To refer to data in a change-sensitive manner | To store a collection of data in a change-sensitive manner | To create computationally expensive tasks | . | . Step 12: Identifying and protecting user accounts . The major goal of cryptography is to protect data from being accessed by unauthorized people. | The major cryptographic activities are: Encryption: Protecting data by turning them into cypher text by utilizing a cryptographic key | Decryption: Turning cypher text back into useful data by utilizing a matching cryptographic key | Asymmetric cryptography always uses two complementary keys: cypher text created with one of these keys can only be decrypted with the other key and vice versa. | . | When utilizing asymmetric cryptography in real life, these keys are typically called the public key and private key in order to highlight their role. The public key is shared with everyone, while the private key is kept secret. For this reason, asymmetric cryptography is also called public-private-key cryptography. | There are two classical use cases of public and private keys: Everyone uses the public key to encrypt data that can only be decrypted by the owner of the corresponding private key. This is the digital equivalent to a public mailbox where everyone can put letters in but only the owner can open it. | The owner of the private key uses it to encrypt data that can be decrypted by everyone who possesses the corresponding public key. This is the digital equivalent to a public notice board that proves authorship. | . | The blockchain uses asymmetric cryptography in order to achieve two goals: Identifying accounts: User accounts are public cryptographic keys. | Authorizing transactions: The owner of the account who hands off ownership creates a piece of cypher text with the corresponding private key. This piece of cypher text can be verified by using the corresponding public key, which happens to be the number of the account that hands off ownership. | . | . Step 13: Authorizing transactions . Digital signatures are the digital equivalent to handwritten signatures and serve two purposes: Identify its author uniquely | State agreement of its author with the content of a document and authorize its execution | . | In the blockchain, digital signatures of transactions are cryptographic hash values of transaction data encrypted with the private key that corresponds to the account that hands off ownership. | Digital signatures in the blockchain can be trace back uniquely to one specific private key and to one specific transaction in one process. | . Step 14: Storing transaction data . The blockchain-data-structure is a specific kind of data structure that is made up of ordered units called blocks. | Each block of the blockchain-data-structure consists of a block header and a Merkle tree that contains transaction data. | The blockchain-data-structure consists of two major data structures: an ordered chain of block headers and Merkle trees. | One can imagine the ordered chain of block headers as being the digital equivalent to an old-fashioned library card catalog, where the individual catalog cards are sorted according to the order in which they were added to the catalog. | Having each block header referencing its preceding block header preserves the order of the individual block headers and blocks, respectively, that make up the blockchain-data-structure. | Each block header in the blockchain-data-structure is identified by its cryptographic hash value and contains a hash reference to its preceding block header and a hash reference to the application-specific data whose order it maintains. | The hash reference to the application-specific data is typically the root of a Merkle tree that maintains hash references to the application-specific data. | . Step 15: Using the data store - chaining blocks of data . The steps to be performed in order to add new transaction data to the blockchain-data-structure are: Create a new Merkle tree that contains all new transaction data to be added. | Create a new block header that contains both a hash reference to its preceding header and the root of the Merkle tree that contains the new transaction data. | Create a hash reference to the new block header, which is now the current head of the blockchain-data-structure. | . | Changing data in the blockchain-data-structure requires renewing all hash references starting with the one that directly points to the manipulated data and ending with the head of the whole blockchain-data-structure as well as all hash references in between them. | The blockchain-data-structure pursues a radical all-or-nothing approach when it comes to changing its data: One either changes the whole data structure completely starting from the point that causes the change until the head of the whole chain or one better leave it unchanged in the first place. | All half-hearted, halfway through, or partial changes will leave the whole blockchain-data-structure in an inconsistent state, which will be detected easily and quickly. | Changing the blockchain-data-structure completely is a very elaborate process on purpose. | The high sensitivity of the blockchain-data-structure regarding changes is due to the properties of hash references. | . Step 16: Protecting the data store - discovering the power of immutability . The blockchain protects the history of transaction data from manipulation and forgery by storing transaction data in an immutable data store. | The history of a transaction is made immutable by utilizing two ideas: Storing the transaction data in the change-sensitive blockchain-data-structure, which when being changed requires rewriting the data structure starting at the point that causes the change until the head of the whole chain. | Requiring the solution of a hash puzzle for writing, rewriting, or adding every single block header in the blockchain-data-structure. | . | The hash puzzle is unique for each block header because it depends on its unique content. | The need to rewrite the blockchain-data-structure when it is changed and the costs of doing so make it unattractive to manipulate the history of transaction data in the first place. | Requiring the solution of a hash puzzle for every writing, rewriting or adding of block headers in the blockchain-data-structure turns is into an append-only data store. | A block header contains at least the following data: A hash reference to the header of its preceding block | The root of a Merkle tree that contains transaction data | The difficulty of its hash puzzle | The time when solving the hash puzzle was started | The nonce that solves the hash puzzle | . | . Step 17: Distributing the data store among peers . Computers in a distributed peer-to-peer system communicate with one another via a digital network. | Due to the omnipresence of the Internet, it is compelling to create a distributed peer-to-peer system by connecting the individual nodes via the Internet. | A peer-to-peer system that uses the Internet as a medium of communication is characterized by the following facts: The computers are connected with one another via the Internet. | Each computer is identified by a unique address. | Each computer can disconnect and reconnect to the system at any given time. | Each computer independently maintains a list of peers with which it communicates. | Communication between nodes is based on messages. | Messages are sent from one node to another over the Internet by using their unique addresses. | . | Due to the adversaries of networks, the communication among the nodes is characterized by the following facts: Messages are not guaranteed to arrive at the addressees, but they may get lost instead. | Messages may arrive more than once. | Messages may arrive in a different order than they were sent. | . | The blockchain counteracts the adversaries of communicating over an unreliable network in the following ways: Messages are sent in a gossip style. Every node that receives a message will forward it to the peers it communicates with, which in turn will handle the message in the same way. | Duplicates of transactions or blocks are identified and filtered out based on their cryptographic hash values. | Each node can order the received information because transaction data and block headers contain time stamps. | . | The communication among the computers that make up the peer-to-peer system serves the following three purposes: Keeping existing connections alive | Establishing new connections | Distributing new information | . | Forwarding ownership-related information happens on three occasions: In an ongoing fashion by forwarding new transaction data and new blocks to all nodes that are connected to the system | As an update for nodes that reconnect to the system after being disconnected for a while | As part of the on-boarding procedure that transfers a copy of the whole up-to-date version of the blockchain-data-structure to the new nodes to ensure that they become full-fledged nodes after joining the system | . | . Step 18: Verifying and adding transactions . The blockchain-algorithm is a series of rules and instructions that governs the way in which transaction data are processed and added to the system. | The challenge solved by the blockchain-algorithm is to keep the system open to everyone while ensuring that only valid and authorized transactions are added. | The blockchain-algorithm utilizes the carrot-and-stick approach, combined with competition and peer control. | The major idea of the blockchain-algorithm is to allow all nodes of the system to act as supervisors of their peers and reward them for adding valid and authorized transactions and for finding errors in the work of others. | Due to the rules of the blockchain-algorithm, all nodes of the system have an incentive to process transactions correctly and to supervise and point out any mistakes made by the other peers.” | The blockchain-algorithm is based on the following concepts: Validation rules for transaction data and block headers | Reward for submitting valid blocks | Punishment for counteracting the integrity of the system | Competition among peers for earning reward based on processing speed and quality | Peer control | . | The rules of the competition establish a two-step rhythm that governs the work of every node in the network. At any given point in time, all nodes of the system are in either of the two phases: Evaluating a new block that was created by others | Trying hard to be the next node that creates a new block that has to be evaluated by all others | . | The working rhythm is imposed by the arrival of messages at the individual nodes. | The majority of honest nodes and their striving for reward will outweigh the attempts of dishonest nodes to counteract the integrity of the system. | . Step 19: Choosing a transaction history . Delays in sending new blocks across the network or two nodes creating new blocks nearly at the same time cause the blockchain-data-structure to grow into the shape of a tree or a columnar cactus with branches that arise from a common trunk that represent conflicting versions of the transaction history. | Selecting an identical version of the transaction history is a collective decision-making problem. | Distributed consensus is an agreement among the members of a purely distributed peer-to-peer system in a collective decision-making problem. | The collective decision-making problem of the blockchain is characterized by the following facts: All nodes operate in the identical environment, consisting of the network, nodes that maintain their individual copies of the blockchain-data-structure, and the blockchain-algorithm that governs the behavior of the nodes. | The decision-making problem is to select the identical transaction history across all nodes. | All nodes strive to maximize their individual income earned as a reward for adding new valid blocks to the blockchain-data-structure. | In order to achieve their goals, all nodes send their new blocks to all their peers to have them examined and accepted. As a result, each nodes leaves its individual footprint in the environment that is the collectively maintained blockchain-data-structure. | All nodes use the identical criterion for selecting a history of transaction data. | . | The longest-chain-criterion states that each node independently chooses the path of the tree-shaped blockchain-data-structure that contains the most blocks. | The heaviest-chain-criterion states that each node independently chooses that path of the tree-shaped blockchain-data-structure that has the highest aggregated difficulty. | Selecting one path of the tree-shaped blockchain-data-structure has the following consequences: Orphan blocks | Reclaimed reward | Clarifying ownership | Reprocessing of transactions | A growing common trunk | Eventual consistency | Robustness against manipulations | . | The deeper down the authoritative chain a block is located: The further in the past it was added | The more time has passed since its inclusion in the blockchain-data-structure | The more common effort has been spent on adding subsequent blocks | The less it is affected by random changes of the blocks that belong to the longest chain | The less likely it will be abandoned | The more accepted it is by the nodes of the system | The more anchored it is in the common history of the nodes | . | The fact that certainty concerning the inclusion of blocks in the authoritative chain increases as time goes by and as more blocks are added eventually is called eventually consistency. | A 51 percent attack is an attempt to gather or control the majority of the whole voting power in a collective decision-making process with the goal to turn blocks that are part of the authoritative chain into orphan blocks and establish a new authoritative chain that contains a transaction history that is more favorable from the attackers point of view. | A 51 percent attack has the following characteristics: Economically: Changing the allocation of ownership rights by changing the collective history of transaction data. | Decision making: Gathering the majority of voting power in order to enforce a desired result. | Technically: Undermining the integrity of the system. | Architecturally: Establish at least temporarily a hidden element of centrality that changes the state of the system. | . | . Step 20: Paying for Integrity . The blockchain utilizes fees for compensating its peers for contributing to the integrity of the system. | The instrument of payment used to compensate peers has an impact on major aspects of the blockchain such as: Integrity | Openness | The distributed nature | The philosophy of the system | Desirable properties of an instrument of payment for compensating peers are: | Being available in digital form | Being accepted in the real world | Being accepted in all countries | Not being the subject to capital movement restrictions | Being trustworthy | Not being controlled by one single central organization or state | . | A cryptocurrency is an independent digital currency whose ownership is managed by a blockchain that uses it as an instrument of payment for compensating its peers for maintaining the integrity of the system. | . Step 21: Bringing the pieces together . The blockchain is a purely distributed peer-to-peer system that addresses the following aspects of managing ownership: Describing ownership: History of Transaction Data | Protecting ownership: Digital Signature | Storing transaction data: Blockchain-Data-Structure | Preparing ledgers for being distributed: Immutability | Distributing ledgers: Gossip-Style Information Forwarding Through a Network | Processing new transactions: Blockchain-Algorithm | Deciding which ledger represents the truth: Distributed Consensus | . | Analyzing the blockchain involves the following aspects: The application goal | Its properties | Its internal functioning | . | The blockchain has two application goals: Clarifying ownership | Transferring ownership | . | The blockchain fulfills its application goals while exhibiting the following qualities: Highly available | Censorship proof | Reliable | Open | Pseudoanonymous | Secure | Resilient | Eventually consistent | Keeping integrity | . | Internally the blockchain consists of components that are either specific or agnostic to the application goal of managing ownership. | The application-specific components of the blockchain are: Ownership logic | Transaction data | Transaction processing logic | Transaction security | . | The application-agnostic components are: The blockchain-technology-suite | The purely distributed peer-to-peer architecture | . | The blockchain-technology-suite consists of: Storage logic | Consensus logic | Data processing logic | Asymmetric cryptography | . | . Stage 4: Limitations and how to overcome them . Step 22: Seeing the limitations . The openness of the blockchain and the absence of any form of central control are the fundamentals of its functioning but can also cause limitations for its adoption. | Major technical limitations of the blockchain are: Lack of privacy | The security model | Limited scalability | High costs | Hidden centrality | Lack of flexibility | Critical size | . | The most important nontechnical limitations of the blockchain are: Lack of legal acceptance | Lack of user acceptance | Technical limitations of the blockchain can be overcome by improving the existing technology or by introducing conceptual changes. | The nontechnical limitations of the blockchain can be overcome by educational and legislative initiatives. | . | . Step 23: Reinventing the Blockchain . The blockchain inherently contains the following conflicts: Transparency vs. privacy: On the one hand, transparency is needed for clarifying ownership and preventing double spending, but on the other hand, its users require privacy. | Security vs. speed: On the one hand, protecting the history of transaction data from being manipulated is done by utilizing the computationally expensive proof of work, but on the other hand, speed and scalability are required in most commercial contexts. | . | The transparency vs. privacy conflict has its root in the allocation of reading access rights to the blockchain-data-structure. | The security vs. speed conflict has its root in the allocation of writing access rights to the blockchain-data-structure. | Solving the transparency vs. privacy conflict led to the following versions of the blockchain: Public blockchains grant reading access and the right to create new transactions to all users or nodes. | Private blockchains limit reading access and the right to create new transactions to a preselected group of users or nodes. | . | Solving the security vs. speed conflict led to the following versions of the blockchain: Permissionless blockchains grant writing access to everyone. Every user or node can verify transaction data and create and add new blocks to the blockchain-data-structure. | Permissioned blockchains grant writing access only to a limited group of preselected nodes or users that are identified as trustworthy through an on-boarding process. | . | Combining these restrictions pairwise led to the emergence of four different kinds of blockchains. | Restricting reading or writing access results in consequences on the following properties of the blockchain: The peer-to-peer architecture | The distributed nature | Its purpose | . | The blockchain-technology-suite causes value even in restricted environments for the following reasons: The number of nodes can vary due to technical failures or downtime. | Every distributed system faces the adversaries of networks that make communication on the level of individual messages unreliable. | Even an on-boarding process may not guarantee the trustworthiness of nodes at a 100 percent level. | Even trustworthy nodes may yield wrong results due to technical failures. | . | . Stage 5: Using the Blockchain, Summary and Outlook . Step 24: Using the Blockchain . The blockchain can be considered a purely distributed data store with additional properties such as being immutable, append-only, ordered, time-stamped, and eventually consistent. | Being a generic data store means that the blockchain can store a wide range of data, which in turn makes it usable in a wide range of application areas. | Based on its properties, we can identify the following generic-use patterns of the blockchain: Proof of existence | Proof of nonexistence | Proof of time | Proof of order | Proof of identity | Proof of authorship | Proof of ownership | . | Specific application areas of the blockchain that have already received attention or may receive attention in the future are: Payments | Cryptocurrencies | Micropayments | Digital assets | Digital identity | Notary services | Compliance and audit | Tax | Voting | Record management | . | When analyzing specific blockchain applications or blockchain services, some questions need to be answered: What kind of blockchain is used? | Are the requirements for using the blockchain fulfilled? | What is the added value of using a purely distributed peer-to-peer system? | What is the application idea? | What is the business case? | How are peers compensated for contributing resources to the system? | . | . Step 25: Summarizing and going further . The blockchain has been and will continue to be the subject of further improvements and developments such as variations in its implementation, improving efficiency, improving scalability, and conceptual advances. | Smart contracts, zero-knowledge proofs, and alternative ways to achieve consensus are major areas of conceptual advancement of the blockchain. | Besides it technical merits, the blockchain may be honored for the following long-term accomplishments: Disintermediation | Automation | Standardization | Streamlining processes | Increased processing speed | Cost reduction | Shift toward trust in protocols and technology | Making trust a commodity | Increased technology awareness | . | Possible disadvantages of the blockchain are: Lack of privacy | Loss of personal responsibility | Loss of jobs | Reintermediation | . | Possible usages of the blockchain to be seen in the future are: Limited enthusiast projects | Large-scale commercial projects | Governmental projects | . | .",

            "content": ". Silos, Politics and Turf Wars: A Leadership Fable about Destroying the Barriers That Turn Colleagues Into Competitors by Patrick Lencioni . Audible Unabridged, narrated by Eric Conger . This was a re-read (re-listen?) as I had read this a number of years ago when it first came out. I wanted to deploy the idea of defining a thematic goal for my team at work, so I downloaded the audiobook to listen to on my commute. . Introducing the Model . To avoid politics and turf battles, leaders must establish a rallying cry a single overriding theme that remains the top priority of the entire leadership team for a given period of time. In turn, this rallying cry or “thematic goal” serves to align employees throughout the organization and provides an objective tool for resetting direction when things get out of sync. . While it is useful for companies to have both a long term vision and a set of short term, tactical objectives, the thematic goal is intended to bridge the two. It makes the vision more tangible and it gives the tactical objectives more context. . For the thematic goal to take root in an organization, it needs to originate at the executive team level. Once the thematic goal is set for the organization, each department can then create a corresponding thematic goal. . Definitions . Thematic Goal: A single, qualitative focus or rallying cry that is shared by the entire leadership team and ultimately, by the entire organization-and that applies for only a specified period of time. . Defining Objectives: The temporary, qualitative components that serve to clarify exactly what is meant by the Thematic Goal; shared by all members of the team (and usually varying in number from four to six). . Standard Operating Objectives: Other key objectives that an executive team must focus on and monitor. These objectives do not go away from period to period and often include topics such as: revenue, expenses, customer satisfaction, quality etc. .",

            "content": ". Radical Candor: Be a Kick-Ass Boss Without Losing Your Humanity by Kim Malone Scott . Kindle . I first came across the author in a article describing the TED Talk she had given on the primary concept behind Radical Candor - that as a manager you need to both Care Personally and Challenge Directly. The article and talk resonated well with me but when the book came out I was worried that it really only had one great idea that would be repeated in different variations ad nauseum through the book. I was pleasantly suprised to found that the book had greater depth and a number of valuable lessons in it. . Part 1: A New Management Philosophy . Chapter 1: Build Radically Candid Relationships . Bosses guide a team to achieve results | Manager’s three areas of responsibility: Guidance: Create a culture of guidance (praise and criticism) that will keep everyone moving in the right direction. | Team-building: Understand what motivates each person on your team well enough to avoid burnout or boredon and keep the team cohesive. | Results: Drive results collaboratively | . | “It isn’t simply a matter of allowing your approach to your responsibilities to show that you care, however; you must also care deeply about people while being prepared to be hated in return.” | ‘Radical Candor’ is what happens when you put ‘Care Personally’ and ‘Challenge Directly’ together | . Chapter 2: Get, Give, and Encourage Guidance . ‘Obnoxious aggression’ - when you challenge directly but don’t care personally | ‘Manipulative insincerity’ - when you don’t challenge directly or care personally | ‘Ruinous empathy’ - when you care personally but don’t challenge directly . | Radical candor: “Whisper: ‘Your fly is down!’ “ | Obnoxious aggression: “Shout: ‘Look, his fly is down!’ “ | Manipulative insincerity: Silent - worried about your feelings | Ruinous empathy: Silent - worried about his feelings | . Chapter 3: Understand What Motivates Each Person on Your Team . Superstar Steep growth trajectory | Change agent | Ambitious at work | Want new opportunities | . | Rockstar Gradual growth trajectory | Force for stability | Ambitious outside of work | Happy in the current role | . | Your job as manager is not to provide purpose but instead to get to know each of your direct reports well enough to understand how each one derives meaning from work . | Excellent Performance: Keep your top performers top of mind | Excellent Performance / Gradual growth trajectory: Recognize, reward but don’t promote | Excellent Performance / Steep growth trajectory: Keep superstars challenged (and figure out who’ll replace them when they move on) | Managing the middle: Raise the bar - there’s no such thing as a B-player | Poor Performance / Negative growth trajectory: Part ways | Questions to consider before letting someone go: Have you given Radically Candid guidance? | How is this person’s poor performance affecting the rest of the team? | Have you sought out a second opinion, spoken to someone whom you truyst and with whom you can talk the problem through? | . | Common lies managers tell themselves to avoid firing someone who needs to be fired: It will get better | Somebody is better than nobody | A transfer is the answer | It’s bad for morale | . | Low performance / Steep growth trajectory: Manager, look yourself in the mirror! Wrong role | New to role; too much too fast | Personal problems | Poor fit | . | No permanent markers: people change and you have to change with them | . Have you ever underestimated an employee’s contributions because they weren’t gunning for a promotion? What happened? Did you regret it? Have you ever clipped the wings of an employee on a steep growth trajectory? What happened? Did you regret it? Are you more at risk of being an absentee manager or a micromanager? What kinds of situations push you towards one of these modes? Are you currently on a gradual or steep growth trajectory? Were you ever on the opposite one? . Chapter 4: Drive Results Collaboratively . Have you ever tried to tell a team of people what to do? What were the results? Which step(s) of the Get Stuff Done (GSD) Wheel are easiest or most comfortable for you? What steps do you tend to skip? Where do you get stuck? What are some of the practices your team or organization has today that fall into the different steps of the GSD wheel? Are you a quiet listener or a loud listener? Do you want to foster a culture of debate on a team? If so, how will you do it? If not, why not? How do you help your team make decisions? Are you worried you grab too many decisions? . Part 2: Tools &amp; Techniques . Chapter 5: Relationships . What activities do you do to stay centered? Describe an experience when you weren’t able to bring your best self to work. What happened? How do you build trust with your direct reports/ staff? What strategies or activities have been most effective, and how can you tell? . Chapter 6: Guidance . Have you solicited feedback from your direct reports/staff? If so, how have you done it, and has it been successful? Do you have a go-to question for soliciting feedback? What is it? What are some of the ways that you have rewarded criticism? Which of the book’s tips for giving guidance did you find most helpful? What’s something you could do tomorrow with someone on your team to offer Radical Candor? . Chapter 7: Team . Do you or can you begin facilitating “Career Conversations” with your direct reports, as a way of caring personally and helping them map out their career trajectories? Do you know the balance of rock stars and superstars on your team? How do you think about growth for different people?

I went back and read all the novels from the start and have eagerly read every new release since, plus pretty much everything else that Connelly has written. I’m not particularly a crime-fiction addict but have gotten addicted to Connelly’s writing and his characters and the LA setting for his stories. The main character, Harry Bosch, is (over the series of books) so richly drawn that he almost feels real to me. Amazon created the Bosch tv series a few years back, and its pretty good, but doesn’t compare to the Bosch that I’ve built in my head over the years from reading the books. . In the overall body of work, The Wrong Side of Goodbye doesn’t particularly stand out. For a Connelly fan though, it’s essential reading. One of the signs of the quality of the writing for me is that I’m barely conscious of the writing - you just slip into the story and get carried along. . “Everybody counts or nobody counts” - Harry Bosch .",

She’s nowhere near as prolific as Connelly - I think this is her sixth novel. Each novel is set in Ireland, most of them cases for the (fictitious) Dublin Murder Squad. Each novel takes a minor character from the previous book and makes him or her the main protagonist in the new book. . I just love her writing and the edgy, slightly creepy atmosphere she manages to create. Most of her novels so far have had a shadow of the supernatural hanging over them without quite losing touch with reality - just enough to make you wonder if something not quite natural is at play. Her last novel, The Secret Place probably probably had the most overtly supernatural elements, whereas this novel probably has the least. The other element to most of her novels to date is that the protagonist in each somehow comes undone in some way, even as he or she solves the case, some fatal flow in their character causes their victory to turn out hollow in some way. That’s one of the things I’ve really liked in her work. The Trespasser goes easier on the protagonists than her previous work - there’s no personal tragedy awaiting them at the end, which is good and bad. This seems to be her most straight-up detective story of her novels so far. . Overall, though, another excellent novel from Tana French - can’t wait for the next one! .",

Qasim Rashid is an acquaintance of mine - it would probably be a stretch to call him a friend. This book was funded on Kickstarter and I was one of the 337 backers. Having seen Qasim speak at various events and clips of his regular interviews on Fox News and CNN etc (he’s an official spokesperson for the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, USA - an organization which I am also a member), I was expecting a decent enough book, but not necessarily anything exceptional. . I was blown away by this book. I received a printed copy as part of the Kickstarter (one of the few physical books I read in 2016) and once I started reading it I couldn’t stop. The book is basically a series of stories from Qasim’s life, as well as stories from a number of guest contributors. The theme is reflected in the title of the book - the need for people from different backgrounds to discard their pre-conceptions about what the “other” is like and just talk to each other, listen to each other’s stories and find mutual understanding. . I was deeply moved by ‘A Parent by Any Other Name’, a chapter contributed by NICU (neonatal intensive care unit) nurse, Nusrat Jehan Chaudhry, who cares for premature infants in the NICU but cannot have children of her own. Much of the book is about being Muslim in the US and the need for interpersonal dialog between people of different faiths, but there are also a number of powerful storeis here on race and the continuing struggle of African-Americans for equal treatment in the USA. There are stories from white and black Christians, from Jews and Atheists. . Read this book - you’ll be glad you did. .",

Chaos Monkeys: Obscene Fortune and Random Failure in Silicon Valley by Antonio Garcia Martinez | Disrupted: My Misadventure in the Start-Up Bubble by Dan Lyons | The Hard Thing About Hard Things: Building a Business When There Are No Easy Answers by Ben Horowitz | . Three books set in startup land, each with a very different perspective on the startup experience. . The most enjoyable of the books is Chaos Monkeys. The author, Antonio Garcia Martinez, describes his journey from being a Strat at Goldman Sachs to moving to join an advertising startup in Silicon Valley to founding his own startup to selling the company to Twitter while engineering a job for himself at Facebook to his ultimate ejection from Facebook. He comes across as quite a rascal, super-smart, ascerbic and driven; someone who doesn’t suffer fools gladly and by his account he comes across a lot of fools on his journey. . For me the most interesting part of the book was the short period running his own startup - breaking free of the company he was working for, getting accepted into Y-Combinator, dealing with angel investors and VCs, to being acqui-hired by Twitter (with the twist that he himself is acqui-hired by Facebook). I found it fascinating and educational even without all the salacious insider-gossip-type details the author throws in. . I was less impressed by Disrupted, the story of an old-school writer/editor who gets laid off by Newsweek and decides to venture into startup land, albeit in Boston rather than Silicon Valley. I think I was put off by the snarky, “I’m the only sane person in the building” tone to the book - you could sense an almost continuous rolling of the eyes. There’s definitely another side to this story that I would be interested in hearing about. That being said, the company he joins, HubSpot, does seem highly dysfunctional. The behavior Lyons describes seems more like very poor management practices than some unique aspect of modern-day startups. He also is very sarcastic about the DiSC Assessment which I happen to find very useful, even if the underlying science is a bit shaky - that probably biased me against the author ;-) . Twenty minutes in to the audiobook version of The Hard Thing About Hard Things I had a foreboding that it might be a waste of time - the books starts off with some anecdotes about the author’s youth that seemed a bit shallow. However, the book does improve greatly and by the end I was glad that I had read it. Although the book does talk about the author’s experiences in two different startups, it concerns itself mostly with the phase when I started is well-funded has a sizeable number of people working for it and needs to act like a proper company - not the three guys hacking away in a rented apartment that Chaos Monkeys describes. As such it offers a lot of advice for someone transitioning from Founder to CEO. Not sure I’ll ever get to the place where his advice will come in useful, but a worthwhile read nonetheless. .",

I read this at it was chosen as the first book for the Farnam Street Blog Virtual Reading Group. It’s unlikely to be something I would have naturally read otherwise, but it turned out to be fascinating read. . The book is essentially a tour through the birth of the theory of evolution, through to island biogeography and conservation biology. You get to meet the scientists at the heart of these developments from Alfred Russel Wallace and Charles Darwin, to E.O. Wilson, Jared Diamond and many others. You also get to tour the world from Indonesia to the Galapagos to Madagascar to Tasmania and many other places. You also get to meet many different species of animal, some of which are now extinct and many of which may be on their way. It’s a long book, but never boring. . The book is replete with interesting stories. Although almost everyone has heard of the Dodo, another animal mentioned in the book is the Passenger Pigeon. Now extinct, there were 3-5 billion of them in North America in the 18th and 19th centuries, but they became extinct by 1900. . Having only ever studied a minimal amount of biology at school, I really only had a shallow understanding of evolution and how new species are created. My understanding is much improved after reading this book, though it has now opened a whole new set of questions for me. . One other benefit in reading this book is that you’ll pick up a plethora of new and interesting words for your vocabulary. This is where the Kindle really comes in handy, as you can just highlight a word to bring up the dictionary entry for it. Unfortunately, I didn’t make note of those interesting words as I was reading and can no longer remember any of them - a lesson for the future. Going forwards I will be adding all the interesting words to my notes for the book on the kindle. .",

The book is another one of those ‘business fables’ (a la Patrick Lencioni) that gets its points across via a fictional story. As for most of these books, dont expect a work of art, but its an effective way to get information across and more enjoyable than reading a dry treatise on a management topic.

For small companies/teams, a single OKR is preferable; 2-3 are probably acceptable for a larger organization; 5 is too many to remember and track. .

These are two books that try and provide leadership and management guidance based on the experiences of the authors in the U.S. Navy - Marquet as commander of a nuclear powered submarine, the USS Santa Fe, Abrashoff as commander of a guided missile destroyer, the USS Benfold. I had read It’s Your Ship some years earlier, and re-read it after reading Turn the Ship Around. . Both books provide the same general message - that of empowering your team to make decisions and take the initiative. Both contained entertaining stories about the ups and downs - pun intended! - of naval life. Although I enjoyed reading both, I think Turn the Ship Around has more useful takeaways. . Marquet’s book details his transformation from the traditional ‘Leader-Follower’ model typically seen in the navy as well as in business, where the leader gives the orders and his or her followers carry them out, to a ‘Leader-Leader’ model where followers are empowered to make decisions about how to carry out the leader’s intent. This manifested itself in the crew of the USS Santa Fe moving from asking permission from a superior to carry out an action (“Permission to …., Sir?” - “Permission granted”) to one of declaring intent (“I intend to …, Sir” - “Very well”). The difference being that the former transfers responsibility to the leader who is giving the order, whereas the latter shifts ownership of the action to the person carrying it out. .",

I ended up getting the audiobook on Audible and backed it up with a Kindle version. The eBook is the Dover Thrift Edition - a modernized version of the George Long translation. I’m not entirely sure which translation is used in the audiobook. The narrator is pretty good but I found the density of the prose in the book required a level of concentration not typical when listening to audiobooks. There are a lot of ideas presented in the book requiring contemplation, but if you even briefly get distracted by your contemplations the audiobook has moved on. I think this why I generally prefer listen to fiction on audiobook rather than non-fiction, though I find history also seems to work well on audiobook. . As to Meditations, I understand now why so many have recommended this book. Marcus Aurelius was a Roman Emperor who ascended to the throne in 161 AD. This book contains his reflections on life and how to live it, based on the precepts of Stoicism, of which Aurelius was a disciple. Meditations is actually made of up 12 books. The first book is a list of people who have influenced his life and what he learnt from each. I found this to be very profound - the idea that there is something to be learnt from everyone that you interact with. It certainly got me thinking about the people who have influenced me and what I learnt from them - something I would like to put in to writing at some point in my life. The rest of the books are a series of meditations on various aspects of life. On first study, I couldn’t easily discern specific themes for each book though. . This is a book to return to multiple times. I have read that the 2002 translation by Gregory Hays is more easily digestible, others recommend the 1964 transation by Maxwell Staniforth . There definitely seems to be a lot of variability between translations. . I really liked the Stoic philosophy as presented in Meditations - I find a lot of congruence between it and the fundamental teachings of Islam, with one or two basic differences. The Serenity Prayer: . God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, Courage to change the things I can, And wisdom to know the difference. . could easily be a succinct encapsulation of the philosophy presented in Meditations. . A random quote from Mediations - Book VII, line 54: . Everywhere and at all times it is in your power piously to acquiesce in your present condition, and to behave justly to those aroud you, and to exert your skill upon your present thoughts, that nothing shall steal into them without being well examined. .",

Do No Harm: Stories of Life, Death, and Brain Surgery by Henry Marsh | When Breath Becomes Air by Paul Kalanithi | Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End by Atul Gowande | . I read these three books all on a medical theme in a row. They were three of the best books I read all year - all highly recommended. (I actually listened to the audiobook version of all three - I can recommend the audio versions of Do No Harm and Being Mortal, but found the narrator of When Breath Becomes Air to be insufferable - I suggest you stick to the print or ebook version of that book.) They each provide a different viewpoint on life and death, without being overly morose or heavy. . Do No Harm is a series of vignettes by retired British neurosurgeon, Dr Henry Marsh. It is a truly compelling read with insights into life, death, medicine, success, failure and much more besides. The author is refreshingly honest about his failures as a surgeon in addition to the soaring successes. I didnt think I’d like it as much as I did. One to go back to again. . When Breath Becomes Air ended up on many best-of-2016 lists, and deservedly so. The book is a memoir of a by-all-accounts brilliant young neurosurgeon, nearing the end of his training, who is diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. The author is..was.. a gifted writer as well as a talented surgeon, and it shows in this book. He started writing the book after the diagnosis and died before he could fully complete it. It’s a book that forces to think deeply about life, death and everything in between. The title comes from Caelica 83, a poem by Baron Brooke Fulke Greville: . You that seek what life is in death, Now find it air that once was breath. New names unknown, old names gone: Till time end bodies, but souls none. Reader! then make time, while you be, But steps to your eternity. . Being Mortal is an exploration of aging and death, and our society’s approach to end-of-life care. I really enjoyed Gowande’s book The Checklist Manifesto and his occasional articles in The New Yorker and thought this book was thought-provoking, moving and eloquent. A must-read, especially for those of us with aging parents, or indeed anyone who hopes to live to an old age. .",

The The New Leader’s 100-Day Action Plan feels the more comprehensive of the two books. It’s organized into four parts: . Become the Best Candidate for the Job | Discover Your New Role | Take Control of Your Own Start | Implement Your 100-Day Action Plan | As mine was an internal move, parts 2 and 3 were more relevant for me. Overall, I found a number of useful ideas - for someone coming in at a very senior executive level, I’m sure the concepts laid out in the book would be extremely relevant. For someone like me at a slightly less elevated level, there’s more constraints on how many of the ideas you can usefully implement. . Your First 100 Days in a New Executive Job has a reasonably similar approach to The New Leader’s 100-Day Action Plan. It has more stories and anecdotes than the latter . MODELS . Core Ideas (Bradt et al) . Get a head start Position yourself for success | Levearge the fuzzy front end | . | Manage the message Take control of Day One | Embed the Burning Imperative | Exploit key Milestones | Invest in Early Wins | . | Build the team Secure ADEPT people in the right roles | Evolve people, plans and practices. | . | . Core Frameworks (Bradt et al) .

I went searching for his books on Amazon, and while they have hardcopy versions of the books referred to in the article, the only e-book available was this one. I purchased it as it was reasonably priced. . It’s a mildly interesting set of quotes from, about or related to Sherlock Holmes. While I’m not a Sherlock Holmes obsessive, I am a fan. I found the book pleasant enough to skim through, but not overly enlightening. Not a book to go out of your way for. .",

I had previously read a couple of Peter Clines novels (“14” and “The Fold”) and really enjoyed them. They had a slightly steampunk feel to them and were clever and creepy at the same time. When I found out he had written a series of novels that were a mashup of DC and Marvel-style super-heroes with the zombie-apocalypse, I was intrigued. . Overall the series was great fun to read - not high art, but well-written. The scenario presented was, I thought, well thought-through so that you didn’t spend all your time picking holes in the story. The writing has surprising (for a super-hero/zombie novel) depth at times - for example this exchange from “Ex-Isle”: . I stood straight and turned to him. “Twenty-two days ago, on the roof of Hollywood and Highland, you told me you wished to be a symbol of hope. This is the challenge of hope versus fear, George. Fear is a simple, base emotion felt by every mammal, one that requires no rational though, no logic. It is an easy thing to rule by fear.” . He looked up. “I don’t want us to be ruling by–” . “It is also”, I continued, “an easy thing to be ruled by it. Making decisions based on fear requires no effort. In challenging times, many people prefer such a path. It is easier to be scared of a situation than to make the effort to understand it. Fear provides an excuse to avoid responsibility. Even before the ex-virus, there were many people throughout history who took advantage of this tendency.” .",

            "content": ". The Effective Manager by Mark Horstman . I started listening to the Manager Tools podcast (Mark Horstman and Mike Auzenne) over ten years ago and am a big fan of their no-nonsense, practical approach to management. I paid for myself to attend one of their Effective Manager conferences (although I think it was called something different back them) when I worked in Chicago. So when I heard that Mark Horstman was going to release a book, I made sure to order a copy. In fact I got both a signed hardcover as well as the eBook for reference on the go. I even gave a copy to every person on my former management team when I moved roles. I don’t necessarily agree with all their advice - and they are very opinionated - but I appreciate that their advice is detailed and actionable. They’ve really thought through this stuff. . Though the book is relatively slim - the podcast material collected over 10 years is voluminous and wouldn’t fit in a single volume - this book covers the core Manager Tools guidance. . For me the heart of the book is actually in the Afterword, and is probably the core reason why I like these guys so much: . …in all the details and recomendations, I hope I haven’t obscured what the engine of your greatness as a manager can be: Love. If you want to be a great manager, do these things with love. What I mean here is professional love: the willingness to risk yourself for the benefit of another. It means doing somethinh that may be a little more difficult for you, as a way of showing respect for your colleagues and your organization. You can be demanding while also showing respect for your team. You don’t have to withhold positive feedback. You can give negative feedback with love in your heart. You can deliver tough messages with kindness. You don’t have to be mean, short, or disrespectful to challenge people. You don’t have to be brusque or rude. You don’t have to “act like the boss”. Nor do you have to sugarcoat hard messages. Be direct, and be kind doing it. That takes love. . Highly recommended for any manager or wanna-be manager. . MODEL .
