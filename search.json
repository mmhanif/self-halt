I used the model from the book with my team at Meta for our second team ‚Äúsummit‚Äù (aka offsite in the world of Finance) and found it very helpful.\nPublisher‚Äôs Description: ‚ÄúNew York Times best-selling author Patrick Lencioni unveils a truly groundbreaking new model that will change the way we think about work and teams forever. The 6 Types of Working Genius is the fastest way to help people identify the type of work that brings them joy and energy, and avoid work that leads to frustration and burnout. Beyond the personal discovery and instant relief that Working Genius provides, the model also gives teams a remarkably simple and practical framework for tapping into one another‚Äôs natural gifts, which increases productivity and reduces unnecessary judgment. In classic Lencioni fashion, Pat brings his model to life in a page-turning fable that is as relatable as it is compelling. He tells the story of Bull Brooks, an entrepreneur, husband, and father who sets out to solve his own frustration at work and stumbles into a new way of thinking that changes the way he sees his work, his team, and even his marriage. What sets this book‚Äîand the model behind it‚Äîapart from other tools and assessments is the speed at which it can be understood and applied, and the relevance it has to every kind of work in life, from running a company to launching a product to managing a family. In addition to this book, Lencioni and the Table Group have created a 10-minute assessment that helps individuals quickly identify their gifts and apply this model to themselves and their teams. Join the hundreds of thousands of people who have already discovered their Working Genius, and experience the transformation in your work, your team, and your life.

Having seen Qasim speak at various events and clips of his regular interviews on Fox News and CNN etc (he‚Äôs an official spokesperson for the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, USA - an organization which I am also a member), I was expecting a decent enough book, but not necessarily anything exceptional.\nI was blown away by this book. I received a printed copy as part of the Kickstarter (one of the few physical books I read in 2016) and once I started reading it I couldn‚Äôt stop. The book is basically a series of stories from Qasim‚Äôs life, as well as stories from a number of guest contributors. The theme is reflected in the title of the book - the need for people from different backgrounds to discard their pre-conceptions about what the ‚Äúother‚Äù is like and just talk to each other, listen to each other‚Äôs stories and find mutual understanding.\nI was deeply moved by ‚ÄòA Parent by Any Other Name‚Äô, a chapter contributed by NICU (neonatal intensive care unit) nurse, Nusrat Jehan Chaudhry, who cares for premature infants in the NICU but cannot have children of her own. Much of the book is about being Muslim in the US and the need for interpersonal dialog between people of different faiths, but there are also a number of powerful storeis here on race and the continuing struggle of African-Americans for equal treatment in the USA. There are stories from white and black Christians, from Jews and Atheists. Read this book - you‚Äôll be glad you did."

    "text": "Range by David Epstein\n\n\nisbn-13: 9780735214484\nAudible\nPublisher‚Äôs Description:\n‚ÄúShares counterintuitive advice on the most effective path to success in any domain while revealing the essential contributions of generalist, not specialist, team members‚Äù\nQuotes\n\nEventual elites typically devote less time early on to deliberate practice in the activity in which they will eventually become experts. Instead, they undergo what researchers call a ‚Äúsampling period.‚Äù They play a variety of sports, usually in an unstructured or lightly structured environment; they gain a range of physical proficiencies from which they can draw; they learn about their own abilities and proclivities; and only later do they focus in and ramp up technical practice in one area.\n\n\nI dove into work showing that highly credentialed experts can become so narrow-minded that they actually get worse with experience, even while becoming more confident‚Äîa dangerous combination. And I was stunned when cognitive psychologists I spoke with led me to an enormous and too often ignored body of work demonstrating that learning itself is best done slowly to accumulate lasting knowledge, even when that means performing poorly on tests of immediate progress. That is, the most effective learning looks inefficient; it looks like falling behind.\n\n\nincreasing specialization has created a ‚Äúsystem of parallel trenches‚Äù in the quest for innovation. Everyone is digging deeper into their own trench and rarely standing up to look in the next trench over, even though the solution to their problem happens to reside there.\n\n\nThe challenge we all face is how to maintain the benefits of breadth, diverse experience, interdisciplinary thinking, and delayed concentration in a world that increasingly incentivizes, even demands, hyperspecialization.\n\n\nThe bestseller Talent Is Overrated used the Polgar sisters and Tiger Woods as proof that a head start in deliberate practice is the key to success in ‚Äúvirtually any activity that matters to you.‚Äù The powerful lesson is that anything in the world can be conquered in the same way. It relies on one very important, and very unspoken, assumption: that chess and golf are representative examples of all the activities that matter to you.\n\n\nIt was a wide-ranging review of research that rocked psychology because it showed experience simply did not create skill in a wide range of real-world scenarios, from college administrators assessing student potential to psychiatrists predicting patient performance to human resources professionals deciding who will succeed in job training. In those domains, which involved human behavior and where patterns did not clearly repeat, repetition did not cause learning. Chess, golf, and firefighting are exceptions, not the rule.\n\n\nIn 2009, Kahneman and Klein took the unusual step of coauthoring a paper in which they laid out their views and sought common ground. And they found it. Whether or not experience inevitably led to expertise, they agreed, depended entirely on the domain in question. Narrow experience made for better chess and poker players and firefighters, but not for better predictors of financial or political trends, or of how employees or patients would perform.\n\n\nThe domains Klein studied, in which instinctive pattern recognition worked powerfully, are what psychologist Robin Hogarth termed ‚Äúkind‚Äù learning environments. Patterns repeat over and over, and feedback is extremely accurate and usually very rapid. In golf or chess, a ball or piece is moved according to rules and within defined boundaries, a consequence is quickly apparent, and similar challenges occur repeatedly.\n\n\nKahneman was focused on the flip side of kind learning environments; Hogarth called them ‚Äúwicked.‚Äù In wicked domains, the rules of the game are often unclear or incomplete, there may or may not be repetitive patterns and they may not be obvious, and feedback is often delayed, inaccurate, or both.\n\n\nOur greatest strength is the exact opposite of narrow specialization. It is the ability to integrate broadly.\n\n\n‚ÄúAI systems are like savants.‚Äù They need stable structures and narrow worlds.\n\n\nWhen narrow specialization is combined with an unkind domain, the human tendency to rely on experience of familiar patterns can backfire horribly‚Äîlike the expert firefighters who suddenly make poor choices when faced with a fire in an unfamiliar structure.\n\n\nAll this is bad news for some of the business world‚Äôs favorite successful-learning analogies‚Äîthe Polgars, Tiger, and to some degree analogies based in any sport or game. Compared to golf, a sport like tennis is much more dynamic, with players adjusting to opponents every second, to surfaces, and sometimes to their own teammates. (Federer was a 2008 Olympic gold medalist in doubles.) But tennis is still very much on the kind end of the spectrum compared to, say, a hospital emergency room, where doctors and nurses do not automatically find out what happens to a patient after their encounter. They have to find ways to learn beyond practice, and to assimilate lessons that might even contradict their direct experience. The world is not golf, and most of it isn‚Äôt even tennis. As Robin Hogarth put it, much of the world is ‚ÄúMartian tennis.‚Äù You can see the players on a court with balls and rackets, but nobody has shared the rules. It is up to you to derive them, and they are subject to change without notice.\n\n\nThe main conclusion of work that took years of studying scientists and engineers, all of whom were regarded by peers as true technical experts, was that those who did not make a creative contribution to their field lacked aesthetic interests outside their narrow area. As psychologist and prominent creativity researcher Dean Keith Simonton observed, ‚Äúrather than obsessively focus[ing] on a narrow topic,‚Äù creative achievers tend to have broad interests. ‚ÄúThis breadth often supports insights that cannot be attributed to domain-specific expertise alone.‚Äù\n\n\nConnolly‚Äôs primary finding was that early in their careers, those who later made successful transitions had broader training and kept multiple ‚Äúcareer streams‚Äù open even as they pursued a primary specialty. They ‚Äútraveled on an eight-lane highway,‚Äù he wrote, rather than down a single-lane one-way street. They had range. The successful adapters were excellent at taking knowledge from one pursuit and applying it creatively to another, and at avoiding cognitive entrenchment. They employed what Hogarth called a ‚Äúcircuit breaker.‚Äù They drew on outside experiences and analogies to interrupt their inclination toward a previous solution that may no longer work. Their skill was in avoiding the same old patterns. In the wicked world, with ill-defined challenges and few rigid rules, range can be a life hack.\n\n\nIn Flynn‚Äôs terms, we now see the world through ‚Äúscientific spectacles.‚Äù He means that rather than relying on our own direct experiences, we make sense of reality through classification schemes, using layers of abstract concepts to understand how pieces of information relate to one another.\n\n\nResearch on thousands of adults in six industrializing nations found that exposure to modern work with self-directed problem solving and nonrepetitive challenges was correlated with being ‚Äúcognitively flexible.‚Äù\n\n\nthat modern life requires range, making connections across far-flung domains and ideas. Luria addressed this kind of ‚Äúcategorical‚Äù thinking, which Flynn would later style as scientific spectacles. ‚Äú[It] is usually quite flexible,‚Äù Luria wrote. ‚ÄúSubjects readily shift from one attribute to another and construct suitable categories. They classify objects by substance (animals, flowers, tools), materials (wood, metal, glass), size (large, small), and color (light, dark), or other property. The ability to move freely, to shift from one category to another, is one of the chief characteristics of ‚Äòabstract thinking.‚Äô‚Äù\n\n\nChicago has long prided itself on a core curriculum dedicated to interdisciplinary critical thinking. The two-year core, according to the university, ‚Äúis intended as an introduction to the tools of inquiry used in every discipline‚Äîscience, mathematics, humanities, and social sciences. The goal is not just to transfer knowledge, but to raise fundamental questions and to become familiar with the powerful ideas that shape our society.‚Äù\n\n\nJeannette Wing, a computer science professor at Columbia University and former corporate vice president of Microsoft Research, has pushed broad ‚Äúcomputational thinking‚Äù as the mental Swiss Army knife. She advocated that it become as fundamental as reading, even for those who will have nothing to do with computer science or programming. ‚ÄúComputational thinking is using abstraction and decomposition when attacking a large complex task,‚Äù she wrote. ‚ÄúIt is choosing an appropriate representation for a problem.‚Äù\n\n\nLike chess masters and firefighters, premodern villagers relied on things being the same tomorrow as they were yesterday. They were extremely well prepared for what they had experienced before, and extremely poorly equipped for everything else. Their very thinking was highly specialized in a manner that the modern world has been telling us is increasingly obsolete. They were perfectly capable of learning from experience, but failed at learning without experience. And that is what a rapidly changing, wicked world demands‚Äîconceptual reasoning skills that can connect new ideas and work across contexts. Faced with any problem they had not directly experienced before, the remote villagers were completely lost. That is not an option for us. The more constrained and repetitive a challenge, the more likely it will be automated, while great rewards will accrue to those who can take conceptual knowledge from one problem or domain and apply it in an entirely new one.\n\n\nThe psychologists highlighted the variety of paths to excellence, but the most common was a sampling period, often lightly structured with some lessons and a breadth of instruments and activities, followed only later by a narrowing of focus, increased structure, and an explosion of practice volume.\n\n\nBut for learning that is both durable (it sticks) and flexible (it can be applied broadly), fast and easy is precisely the problem.\n\n\nKornell was explaining the concept of ‚Äúdesirable difficulties,‚Äù obstacles that make learning more challenging, slower, and more frustrating in the short term, but better in the long term.\n\n\nUsed for learning, testing, including self-testing, is a very desirable difficulty. Even testing prior to studying works, at the point when wrong answers are assured.\n\n\nanother important desirable difficulty: ‚Äúspacing,‚Äù or distributed practice. It is what it sounds like‚Äîleaving time between practice sessions for the same material. You might call it deliberate not-practicing between bouts of deliberate practice.\n\n\nIn 2007, the U.S. Department of Education published a report by six scientists and an accomplished teacher who were asked to identify learning strategies that truly have scientific backing. Spacing, testing, and using making-connections questions were on the extremely short list. All three impair performance in the short term.\n\n\nPsychologist Robert Bjork first used the phrase ‚Äúdesirable difficulties‚Äù in 1994. Twenty years later, he and a coauthor concluded a book chapter on applying the science of learning like this: ‚ÄúAbove all, the most basic message is that teachers and students must avoid interpreting current performance as learning. Good performance on a test during the learning process can indicate mastery, but learners and teachers need to be aware that such performance will often index, instead, fast but fleeting progress.‚Äù\n\n\nfor knowledge to be flexible, it should be learned under varied conditions, an approach called varied or mixed practice, or, to researchers, ‚Äúinterleaving.‚Äù Interleaving has been shown to improve inductive reasoning. When presented with different examples mixed together, students learn to create abstract generalizations that allow them to apply what they learned to material they have never encountered before.\n\n\nDesirable difficulties like testing and spacing make knowledge stick. It becomes durable. Desirable difficulties like making connections and interleaving make knowledge flexible, useful for problems that never appeared in training. All slow down learning and make performance suffer, in the short term.\n\n\nBefore-our-eyes progress reinforces our instinct to do more of the same, but just like the case of the typhoid doctor, the feedback teaches the wrong lesson. Learning deeply means learning slowly. The cult of the head start fails the learners it seeks to serve. Knowledge with enduring utility must be very flexible, composed of mental schemes that can be matched to new problems.\n\n\nWhen a knowledge structure is so flexible that it can be applied effectively even in new domains or extremely novel situations, it is called ‚Äúfar transfer.‚Äù\n\n\n‚ÄúIn my opinion,‚Äù Gentner told me, ‚Äúour ability to think relationally is one of the reasons we‚Äôre running the planet. Relations are really hard for other species.‚Äù Analogical thinking takes the new and makes it familiar, or takes the familiar and puts it in a new light, and allows humans to reason through problems they have never seen in unfamiliar contexts. It also allows us to understand that which we cannot see at all.\n\n\nIn a wicked world, relying upon experience from a single domain is not only limiting, it can be disastrous.\n\n\nThe trouble with using no more than a single analogy, particularly one from a very similar situation, is that it does not help battle the natural impulse to employ the ‚Äúinside view,‚Äù a term coined by psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky. We take the inside view when we make judgments based narrowly on the details of a particular project that are right in front of us.\n\n\nOur natural inclination to take the inside view can be defeated by following analogies to the ‚Äúoutside view.‚Äù The outside view probes for deep structural similarities to the current problem in different ones. The outside view is deeply counterintuitive because it requires a decision maker to ignore unique surface features of the current project, on which they are the expert, and instead look outside for structurally similar analogies. It requires a mindset switch from narrow to broad.\n\n\nPsychologists have shown repeatedly that the more internal details an individual can be made to consider, the more extreme their judgment becomes.\n\n\nIn one of the most cited studies of expert problem solving ever conducted, an interdisciplinary team of scientists came to a pretty simple conclusion: successful problem solvers are more able to determine the deep structure of a problem before they proceed to match a strategy to it. Less successful problem solvers are more like most students in the Ambiguous Sorting Task: they mentally classify problems only by superficial, overtly stated features, like the domain context. For the best performers, they wrote, problem solving ‚Äúbegins with the typing of the problem.‚Äù As education pioneer John Dewey put it in Logic, The Theory of Inquiry, ‚Äúa problem well put is half-solved.‚Äù\n\n\nIn the late 1960s, future Nobel laureate economist Theodore Schultz argued that his field had done well to show that higher education increased worker productivity, but that economists had neglected the role of education in allowing individuals to delay specialization while sampling and finding out who they are and where they fit.\n\n\nLearning stuff was less important than learning about oneself. Exploration is not just a whimsical luxury of education; it is a central benefit.\n\n\nThe expression ‚Äúyoung and foolish,‚Äù he wrote, describes the tendency of young adults to gravitate to risky jobs, but it is not foolish at all. It is ideal. They have less experience than older workers, and so the first avenues they should try are those with high risk and reward, and that have high informational value."

A modern reworking of the greek tragedy Sophocles (not that I‚Äôd read that before coming to this book), at first I was a little bit apprehensive, wondering if this was going to be like a Jonathan Frantzen novel full of unsympathetic characters. I was gradually drawn in by the characters and I found they change of narrator through the book to be very effective at unfolding th plot line from different perspectives. It was a profoundly sad ending and even as I write this I am experiencing a sense of loss over the characters in this wonderful novel."

In this version of America, slavery continues in four states called‚Äùthe Hard Four.‚Äù On the trail of a runaway known as Jackdaw, Victor arrives in Indianapolis knowing that something isn‚Äôt right‚Äìwith the case file, with his work, and with the country itself. A mystery to himself, Victor suppresses his memories of his childhood on a plantation, and works to infiltrate the local cell of a abolitionist movement called the Underground Airlines. Tracking Jackdaw through the back rooms of churches, empty parking garages, hotels, and medical offices, Victor believes he‚Äôs hot on the trail. But his strange, increasingly uncanny pursuit is complicated by a boss who won‚Äôt reveal the extraodinary stakes of Jackdaw‚Äôs case, as well as by a heartbreaking young woman and her child who may be Victor‚Äôs salvation. Victor himself may be the biggest obstacle of all‚Äìthough his true self remains buried, it threatens to surface.

But in pursuing Jackdaw, Victor discovers secrets at the core of the country‚Äôs arrangement with the Hard Four, secrets the government will preserve at any cost.

NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER | NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY The Huffington Post ‚Ä¢ Financial Times ‚Ä¢ Success ‚Ä¢ Inc.¬†‚Ä¢ Library Journal Creativity, Inc.¬†is a manual for anyone who strives for originality and the first-ever, all-access trip into the nerve center of Pixar Animation‚Äîinto the meetings, postmortems, and ‚ÄúBraintrust‚Äù sessions where some of the most successful films in history are made. It is, at heart, a book about creativity‚Äîbut it is also, as Pixar co-founder and president Ed Catmull writes, ‚Äúan expression of the ideas that I believe make the best in us possible.‚Äù For nearly twenty years, Pixar has dominated the world of animation, producing such beloved films as the Toy Story trilogy, Monsters, Inc., Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Up, WALL-E, and Inside Out, which have gone on to set box-office records and garner thirty Academy Awards. The joyousness of the storytelling, the inventive plots, the emotional authenticity: In some ways, Pixar movies are an object lesson in what creativity really is. Here, in this book, Catmull reveals the ideals and techniques that have made Pixar so widely admired‚Äîand so profitable. As a young man, Ed Catmull had a dream: to make the first computer-animated movie. He nurtured that dream as a Ph.D. student at the University of Utah, where many computer science pioneers got their start, and then forged a partnership with George Lucas that led, indirectly, to his co-founding Pixar in 1986. Nine years later, Toy Story was released, changing animation forever. The essential ingredient in that movie‚Äôs success‚Äîand in the thirteen movies that followed‚Äîwas the unique environment that Catmull and his colleagues built at Pixar, based on leadership and management philosophies that protect the creative process and defy convention, such as: ‚Ä¢ Give a good idea to a mediocre team, and they will screw it up. But give a mediocre idea to a great team, and they will either fix it or come up with something better. ‚Ä¢ If you don‚Äôt strive to uncover what is unseen and understand its nature, you will be ill prepared to lead. ‚Ä¢ It‚Äôs not the manager‚Äôs job to prevent risks. It‚Äôs the manager‚Äôs job to make it safe for others to take them. ‚Ä¢ The cost of preventing errors is often far greater than the cost of fixing them. ‚Ä¢ A company‚Äôs communication structure should not mirror its organizational structure. Everybody should be able to talk to anybody.‚Äù"

    "text": "Don‚Äôt Take Yes For An Answer by Steve Herz\n\n\nisbn-13: 9780062869715\nAudible\nI didn‚Äôt hold high hopes for this book. I bought it on a whim during one of Audible‚Äôs $5 sales and was afraid it would just be another regurgitation of bland common sense marketed as a new self-improvement breakthrough.\nHowever, I was pleasantly surprised that there was actually some useful takeaways from this book. The author, Steve Herz, has been an agent and coach for sports, media and entertainment leaders and brings a slightly different perspective to self-improvement.\nThe basic message of the books boils down to the acronym AWE - standing for Authority, Warmth and Energy.\nThe author argues that your non-technical skills and Emotional Intelligence (EQ) is what sets succesful people apart. To build that EQ you need AWE:\n\nA stands for Authority ‚Äî it‚Äôs your voice, your body language, your ability to make eye contact with people. Do you come across as a competent person who knows how to do this job?\nW is for Warmth ‚Äî it‚Äôs the ability to engender trust and make a connection with another person.\nE is for Energy ‚Äî how are you making other people feel? Are you making people feel good about you and about themselves, or are you deflating them?\n\nPublisher‚Äôs Description: ‚ÄúOne of the nation‚Äôs premier talent agents and career advisors shows you how to catapult your career and your life forward with three key communication strategies‚ÄìAuthority, Warmth, and Energy. A self-empowerment guide to achieving your fullest professional and personal potential, Don‚Äôt Take YES for An Answer explains why positive feedback limits personal and professional growth and then teaches you how to embrace hard truths and critical feedback to escape mediocrity and break away from the pack. To stand out, to attract the attention of those who can raise your profile, to protect yourself during lean times, or to gain the interest of future employers, you must harness three critical communication traits that human beings respond to most: AWE: A‚ÄìAuthority. W‚ÄìWarmth. E‚ÄìEnergy. When all else is equal‚Äìeducation, work ethic, intelligence, experience, ambition‚Äì the single biggest factor in winning business, promotions, friendships, or followers hinges on our ability to communicate and connect. Mastering AWE gives you an unparalleled advantage over the competition, no matter your field. Herz, who has represented and coached dozens of sports, media, and entertainment leaders over the course of nearly three decades, delivers a step-by-step program that helps you understand and hone your AWE skills. Packed with inspiring success stories, grounded in the latest social psychology and scientific research, and featuring‚Äùinsider‚Äù anecdotes from some of the most popular entrepreneurs and professionals in broadcasting, sports, and the corporate world‚Äìmany personally coached by Herz‚ÄìDon‚Äôt Take YES for An Answer provides invaluable suggestions and practical techniques for ‚Äúupping‚Äù your AWE in every aspect of your life.‚Äù"

David Marquet\n\n\nisbn-13: 9781591846406\nKindle\nPublisher‚Äôs Description\n‚ÄúOne of the 12 best business books of all time‚Ä¶. Timeless principles of empowering leadership.‚Äù ‚Äì USA Today ‚ÄúThe best how-to manual anywhere for managers on delegating, training, and driving flawless execution.‚Äù ‚ÄîFORTUNE Since Turn the Ship Around! was published in 2013, hundreds of thousands of readers have been inspired by former Navy captain David Marquet‚Äôs true story. Many have applied his insights to their own organizations, creating workplaces where everyone takes responsibility for his or her actions, where followers grow to become leaders, and where happier teams drive dramatically better results. Marquet was a Naval Academy graduate and an experienced officer when selected for submarine command. Trained to give orders in the traditional model of ‚Äúknow all‚Äìtell all‚Äù leadership, he faced a new wrinkle when he was shifted to the Santa Fe, a nuclear-powered submarine. Facing the high-stress environment of a sub where there‚Äôs little margin for error, he was determined to reverse the trends he found on the Santa Fe: poor morale, poor performance, and the worst retention rate in the fleet. Almost immediately, Marquet ran into trouble when he unknowingly gave an impossible order, and his crew tried to follow it anyway. When he asked why, the answer was: ‚ÄúBecause you told me to.‚Äù Marquet realized that while he had been trained for a different submarine, his crew had been trained to do what they were told‚Äîa deadly combination. That‚Äôs when Marquet flipped the leadership model on its head and pushed for leadership at every level. Turn the Ship Around! reveals how the Santa Fe skyrocketed from worst to first in the fleet by challenging the U.S. Navy‚Äôs traditional leader-follower approach. Struggling against his own instincts to take control, he instead achieved the vastly more powerful model of giving control to his subordinates, and creating leaders. Before long, each member of Marquet‚Äôs crew became a leader and assumed responsibility for everything he did, from clerical tasks to crucial combat decisions. The crew became completely engaged, contributing their full intellectual capacity every day. The Santa Fe set records for performance, morale, and retention. And over the next decade, a highly disproportionate number of the officers of the Santa Fe were selected to become submarine commanders. Whether you need a major change of course or just a tweak of the rudder, you can apply Marquet‚Äôs methods to turn your own ship around."

It made me realize this particular trip is something I will never want to subject myself to!\nPublisher‚Äôs Description: ‚ÄúNot many people know that Pakistan is home to 108 peaks above 7,000 meters (22,966 ft.) and many more above 6,000 meters (19,685 ft.). Not only that, 5 out of 14 peaks above 8,000 meters (26,247 ft.) of our planet are in Pakistan. Trek with me to the remote, rugged, and beautiful mountain range, Karakoram of Pakistan, where most of these gorgeous peaks stand tall. Know the ins and outs of the daily drill while you trek all the way to see K2, the second highest peak in the world, via the Concordia Trek on the Baltoro Glacier and then return via Gondogoro La and Hushe of the Karakoram range of Pakistan. Tag along! We will trek more than 85 miles into the thin fresh air reaching approximately 19,000 feet. Trek and camp on the wild glaciers with me. We will travel through the concentration of highest peaks of the world. There are Glaciers so magnificent that they can be seen from space. This book is your user manual on how to see K2 and come back alive. If there would be a place in the world where Mountain Gods would live then the Concordia of the Karakoram would be their throne. This book will humbly take you to the thrones of the Mountain Gods, Concordia-K2-Gondogoro La of Pakistan, and bring you back.‚Äù"

    "text": "The Prosperity Paradox: How Innovation Can Lift Nations Out of Poverty by Clayton M. Christensen\n\n\nisbn-13: 9780062851826\nKindle\nPublisher‚Äôs Description\nClayton M. Christensen, the author of such business classics as The Innovator‚Äôs Dilemma and the New York Times bestseller How Will You Measure Your Life, and co-authors Efosa Ojomo and Karen Dillon reveal why so many investments in economic development fail to generate sustainable prosperity, and offers a groundbreaking solution for true and lasting change. Global poverty is one of the world‚Äôs most vexing problems. For decades, we‚Äôve assumed smart, well-intentioned people will eventually be able to change the economic trajectory of poor countries. From education to healthcare, infrastructure to eradicating corruption, too many solutions rely on trial and error. Essentially, the plan is often to identify areas that need help, flood them with resources, and hope to see change over time. But hope is not an effective strategy. Clayton M. Christensen and his co-authors reveal a paradox at the heart of our approach to solving poverty. While noble, our current solutions are not producing consistent results, and in some cases, have exacerbated the problem. At least twenty countries that have received billions of dollars‚Äô worth of aid are poorer now. Applying the rigorous and theory-driven analysis he is known for, Christensen suggests a better way. The right kind of innovation not only builds companies‚Äîbut also builds countries. The Prosperity Paradox identifies the limits of common economic development models, which tend to be top-down efforts, and offers a new framework for economic growth based on entrepreneurship and market-creating innovation. Christensen, Ojomo, and Dillon use successful examples from America‚Äôs own economic development, including Ford, Eastman Kodak, and Singer Sewing Machines, and shows how similar models have worked in other regions such as Japan, South Korea, Nigeria, Rwanda, India, Argentina, and Mexico. The ideas in this book will help companies desperate for real, long-term growth see actual, sustainable progress where they‚Äôve failed before. But The Prosperity Paradox is more than a business book; it is a call to action for anyone who wants a fresh take for making the world a better and more prosperous place."

    "text": "Model\nThe book consists of 25 steps, grouped into 5 major stages, that all together form a learning pathm which incrementally builds the reader‚Äôs knowledge of the blockchain.\n\nStage 1: Terminology and Technical Foundations\n\nStep 1: Thinking in layers and aspects\n\nSystems can be partioned into application vs implementation and functional vs non-functional aspects.\nIntegrity is a major non-functional aspect, and has three major components:\n\nData Integrity\nBehavioural Integrity\nSecurity\n\nMost software failures are the result of violated system integrity.\n\n\n\nStep 2: Software Architecture and it‚Äôs relation to the Blockchain\n\nSoftware architectures can be centralized or distributed.\nThe blockchain is part of the implementation of a distributed software system*\nThe purpose of the blockchain is to achieve and maintain the integrity of a distributed software system\n\n\n\nStep 3: Recognizing the potential of peer-to-peer systems\n\nPeer-to-peer systems are a specific type of distributed system that allow direct interactions between contractual partners rather than indirect interactions through a middleman.\n\n\n\n\nStage 2: Why the Blockchain is needed\n\nStep 4: Discovering the core problem\n\nIntegrity and trust are major concerns of peer-to-peer (P2P) systems\nMajor integrity threats in P2P systems are:\n\nTechnical failures\nMalicious peers\n\nThe blockchain addresses integrity of a purely distributed P2P system comprised of an unknown number of peers with unknown reliability and trustworthiness.\n\n\n\nStep 5: Disambiguating the term - 4 ways to define the blockchain*\n\nThe term blockchain can be used as:\n\na name for a data-structure: data in units called blocks, connected together like a chain.\na name for an algorithm: the sequence of intructions that negotiated the information content of many blockchain-data-structured in a P2P system.\na name for a suite of technologies: a combination of blockchain data-structure, algorithm and cryptographic and security technlogies that together achieve integrity in a P2P system.\nan umbrella term for purely distributed P2P systems with a common application area\n\nManaging ans clarifying ownership is the most prominent application of the blockchain, but not the only one.\nThe blockchain is a purely distributed peer-to-peer system of ledgers that utilizes a software unit that consist of an algorithm, which negotiates the informational content of ordered and connected blocks of data together with cryptographic and security technologies in order to achieve and maintain its integrity.\n\n\n\nStep 6: Understanding the nature of ownership\n\nProof of ownership has 3 elements:\n\nIdentification of the owner\nIdentification of the object being owned\nMapping the owner to the object\n\nMapping between owners and object can be maintained in a ledger.\nHaving one ledger is risky as it can be damaged, destroyed or forged.\nCan utilize a group of independent ledgers and define ownership based in that version of reality on which the majority of ledgers agree.\nThe blockchain algorith is responsible for letting individual nodes in a blockchain collectively arrive at one consitent version of the state of ownership.\nCryptography is used to ensure identity, authentication and authorization.\nIntegrity in a distributed P2P system of ledgers is found in it‚Äôs ability to make true statements about ownership and to ensure only the owner can transfer their property rights to others.\n\n\n\nStep 7: Spending Money Twice - Examining a vulnerability of distributed P2P systems\n\nDouble-spending can be seen as a problem of maintaining data consistency in distributed P2P systems.\nThe blockchain is a means to solving the double spending problem\n\n\n\n\nStage 3: How the Blockchain works\n\nStep 8: Planning the blockchain\n\nThe following tasks are necessary to design a distributed P2P system of ledgers for managing ownership:\n\nDescribing ownership\nProtecting ownership from unauthorized access\nStoring transaction data\nPreparing ledgers to be distributed in an untrustworthy environment\nDistributing the ledgers\nAdding and verifying new transactions to the ledgers\nDeciding which ledgers represent the truth\n\n\n\n\nStep 9: Documenting Ownership\n\nTransaction data provide the following information for describing a transfer of ownership:\n\nAn identifier of the account who initiates the transaction and is to transfer ownership to another account\nAn identifier of that account that is to receive ownership\nThe amount of the goods to be transferred\nThe time the transaction is to be done\nA fee to be paid to the system for executing the transaction\nA proof that the owner of the account who hands off ownership agrees with that transfer\n\nThe complete history of transaction data is an audit trail that provides evidence of how people acquired and handed off ownership.\nAny transaction not being part of that history is regarded as if it never happened.\nA transaction is executed by adding it to the history of transaction data and allowing it to influence the result of aggregating them.\nThe order in which transaction data are added to the history must be preserved in order to yield identical results when aggregating these data.\nIn order to maintain integrity, only those transaction data are added to the blockchain-data-structure that fulfill the following three criteria:\n\nFormal correctness\nSemantic correctness\nAuthorization\n\n\n\n\nStep 10: Hashing Data\n\nHash functions transform any kind of data into a number of fixed length, regardless of the size of the input data.\nThere are many different hash functions that differ among others with respect to the length of the hash value they produce.\nCryptographic hash functions are an important group of hash functions that create digital fingerprints for any kind of data.\nCryptographic hash functions exhibit the following properties:\n\nProvide hash values for any kind of data quickly\nDeterministic\nPseudorandom\nOne-way usage\nCollision resistant\n\nApplication of hash functions to data can be accomplished by using the following patterns:\n\nRepeated hashing\nIndependent hashing\nCombined hashing\nSequential hashing\nHierarchical hashing\n\n\n\n\nStep 11: Hashing in the real world\n\nHash values can be used:\n\nTo compare data\nTo detect whether data that were supposed to stay unchanged have been altered\nTo refer to data in a change-sensitive manner\nTo store a collection of data in a change-sensitive manner\nTo create computationally expensive tasks\n\n\n\n\nStep 12: Identifying and protecting user accounts\n\nThe major goal of cryptography is to protect data from being accessed by unauthorized people.\nThe major cryptographic activities are:\n\nEncryption: Protecting data by turning them into cypher text by utilizing a cryptographic key\nDecryption: Turning cypher text back into useful data by utilizing a matching cryptographic key\nAsymmetric cryptography always uses two complementary keys: cypher text created with one of these keys can only be decrypted with the other key and vice versa.\n\nWhen utilizing asymmetric cryptography in real life, these keys are typically called the public key and private key in order to highlight their role. The public key is shared with everyone, while the private key is kept secret. For this reason, asymmetric cryptography is also called public-private-key cryptography.\nThere are two classical use cases of public and private keys:\n\nEveryone uses the public key to encrypt data that can only be decrypted by the owner of the corresponding private key. This is the digital equivalent to a public mailbox where everyone can put letters in but only the owner can open it.\nThe owner of the private key uses it to encrypt data that can be decrypted by everyone who possesses the corresponding public key. This is the digital equivalent to a public notice board that proves authorship.\n\nThe blockchain uses asymmetric cryptography in order to achieve two goals:\n\nIdentifying accounts: User accounts are public cryptographic keys.\nAuthorizing transactions: The owner of the account who hands off ownership creates a piece of cypher text with the corresponding private key. This piece of cypher text can be verified by using the corresponding public key, which happens to be the number of the account that hands off ownership.\n\n\n\n\nStep 13: Authorizing transactions\n\nDigital signatures are the digital equivalent to handwritten signatures and serve two purposes:\n\nIdentify its author uniquely\nState agreement of its author with the content of a document and authorize its execution\n\nIn the blockchain, digital signatures of transactions are cryptographic hash values of transaction data encrypted with the private key that corresponds to the account that hands off ownership.\nDigital signatures in the blockchain can be trace back uniquely to one specific private key and to one specific transaction in one process.\n\n\n\nStep 14: Storing transaction data\n\nThe blockchain-data-structure is a specific kind of data structure that is made up of ordered units called blocks.\nEach block of the blockchain-data-structure consists of a block header and a Merkle tree that contains transaction data.\nThe blockchain-data-structure consists of two major data structures: an ordered chain of block headers and Merkle trees.\nOne can imagine the ordered chain of block headers as being the digital equivalent to an old-fashioned library card catalog, where the individual catalog cards are sorted according to the order in which they were added to the catalog.\nHaving each block header referencing its preceding block header preserves the order of the individual block headers and blocks, respectively, that make up the blockchain-data-structure.\nEach block header in the blockchain-data-structure is identified by its cryptographic hash value and contains a hash reference to its preceding block header and a hash reference to the application-specific data whose order it maintains.\nThe hash reference to the application-specific data is typically the root of a Merkle tree that maintains hash references to the application-specific data.\n\n\n\nStep 15: Using the data store - chaining blocks of data\n\nThe steps to be performed in order to add new transaction data to the blockchain-data-structure are:\n\nCreate a new Merkle tree that contains all new transaction data to be added.\nCreate a new block header that contains both a hash reference to its preceding header and the root of the Merkle tree that contains the new transaction data.\nCreate a hash reference to the new block header, which is now the current head of the blockchain-data-structure.\n\nChanging data in the blockchain-data-structure requires renewing all hash references starting with the one that directly points to the manipulated data and ending with the head of the whole blockchain-data-structure as well as all hash references in between them.\nThe blockchain-data-structure pursues a radical all-or-nothing approach when it comes to changing its data: One either changes the whole data structure completely starting from the point that causes the change until the head of the whole chain or one better leave it unchanged in the first place.\nAll half-hearted, halfway through, or partial changes will leave the whole blockchain-data-structure in an inconsistent state, which will be detected easily and quickly.\nChanging the blockchain-data-structure completely is a very elaborate process on purpose.\nThe high sensitivity of the blockchain-data-structure regarding changes is due to the properties of hash references.\n\n\n\nStep 16: Protecting the data store - discovering the power of immutability\n\nThe blockchain protects the history of transaction data from manipulation and forgery by storing transaction data in an immutable data store.\nThe history of a transaction is made immutable by utilizing two ideas:\n\nStoring the transaction data in the change-sensitive blockchain-data-structure, which when being changed requires rewriting the data structure starting at the point that causes the change until the head of the whole chain.\nRequiring the solution of a hash puzzle for writing, rewriting, or adding every single block header in the blockchain-data-structure.\n\nThe hash puzzle is unique for each block header because it depends on its unique content.\nThe need to rewrite the blockchain-data-structure when it is changed and the costs of doing so make it unattractive to manipulate the history of transaction data in the first place.\nRequiring the solution of a hash puzzle for every writing, rewriting or adding of block headers in the blockchain-data-structure turns is into an append-only data store.\nA block header contains at least the following data:\n\nA hash reference to the header of its preceding block\nThe root of a Merkle tree that contains transaction data\nThe difficulty of its hash puzzle\nThe time when solving the hash puzzle was started\nThe nonce that solves the hash puzzle\n\n\n\n\nStep 17: Distributing the data store among peers\n\nComputers in a distributed peer-to-peer system communicate with one another via a digital network.\nDue to the omnipresence of the Internet, it is compelling to create a distributed peer-to-peer system by connecting the individual nodes via the Internet.\nA peer-to-peer system that uses the Internet as a medium of communication is characterized by the following facts:\n\nThe computers are connected with one another via the Internet.\nEach computer is identified by a unique address.\nEach computer can disconnect and reconnect to the system at any given time.\nEach computer independently maintains a list of peers with which it communicates.\nCommunication between nodes is based on messages.\nMessages are sent from one node to another over the Internet by using their unique addresses.\n\nDue to the adversaries of networks, the communication among the nodes is characterized by the following facts:\n\nMessages are not guaranteed to arrive at the addressees, but they may get lost instead.\nMessages may arrive more than once.\nMessages may arrive in a different order than they were sent.\n\nThe blockchain counteracts the adversaries of communicating over an unreliable network in the following ways:\n\nMessages are sent in a gossip style. Every node that receives a message will forward it to the peers it communicates with, which in turn will handle the message in the same way.\nDuplicates of transactions or blocks are identified and filtered out based on their cryptographic hash values.\nEach node can order the received information because transaction data and block headers contain time stamps.\n\nThe communication among the computers that make up the peer-to-peer system serves the following three purposes:\n\nKeeping existing connections alive\nEstablishing new connections\nDistributing new information\n\nForwarding ownership-related information happens on three occasions:\n\nIn an ongoing fashion by forwarding new transaction data and new blocks to all nodes that are connected to the system\nAs an update for nodes that reconnect to the system after being disconnected for a while\nAs part of the on-boarding procedure that transfers a copy of the whole up-to-date version of the blockchain-data-structure to the new nodes to ensure that they become full-fledged nodes after joining the system\n\n\n\n\nStep 18: Verifying and adding transactions\n\nThe blockchain-algorithm is a series of rules and instructions that governs the way in which transaction data are processed and added to the system.\nThe challenge solved by the blockchain-algorithm is to keep the system open to everyone while ensuring that only valid and authorized transactions are added.\nThe blockchain-algorithm utilizes the carrot-and-stick approach, combined with competition and peer control.\nThe major idea of the blockchain-algorithm is to allow all nodes of the system to act as supervisors of their peers and reward them for adding valid and authorized transactions and for finding errors in the work of others.\nDue to the rules of the blockchain-algorithm, all nodes of the system have an incentive to process transactions correctly and to supervise and point out any mistakes made by the other peers.‚Äù\nThe blockchain-algorithm is based on the following concepts:\n\nValidation rules for transaction data and block headers\nReward for submitting valid blocks\nPunishment for counteracting the integrity of the system\nCompetition among peers for earning reward based on processing speed and quality\nPeer control\n\nThe rules of the competition establish a two-step rhythm that governs the work of every node in the network. At any given point in time, all nodes of the system are in either of the two phases:\n\nEvaluating a new block that was created by others\nTrying hard to be the next node that creates a new block that has to be evaluated by all others\n\nThe working rhythm is imposed by the arrival of messages at the individual nodes.\nThe majority of honest nodes and their striving for reward will outweigh the attempts of dishonest nodes to counteract the integrity of the system.\n\n\n\nStep 19: Choosing a transaction history\n\nDelays in sending new blocks across the network or two nodes creating new blocks nearly at the same time cause the blockchain-data-structure to grow into the shape of a tree or a columnar cactus with branches that arise from a common trunk that represent conflicting versions of the transaction history.\nSelecting an identical version of the transaction history is a collective decision-making problem.\nDistributed consensus is an agreement among the members of a purely distributed peer-to-peer system in a collective decision-making problem.\nThe collective decision-making problem of the blockchain is characterized by the following facts:\n\nAll nodes operate in the identical environment, consisting of the network, nodes that maintain their individual copies of the blockchain-data-structure, and the blockchain-algorithm that governs the behavior of the nodes.\nThe decision-making problem is to select the identical transaction history across all nodes.\nAll nodes strive to maximize their individual income earned as a reward for adding new valid blocks to the blockchain-data-structure.\nIn order to achieve their goals, all nodes send their new blocks to all their peers to have them examined and accepted. As a result, each nodes leaves its individual footprint in the environment that is the collectively maintained blockchain-data-structure.\nAll nodes use the identical criterion for selecting a history of transaction data.\n\nThe longest-chain-criterion states that each node independently chooses the path of the tree-shaped blockchain-data-structure that contains the most blocks.\nThe heaviest-chain-criterion states that each node independently chooses that path of the tree-shaped blockchain-data-structure that has the highest aggregated difficulty.\nSelecting one path of the tree-shaped blockchain-data-structure has the following consequences:\n\nOrphan blocks\nReclaimed reward\nClarifying ownership\nReprocessing of transactions\nA growing common trunk\nEventual consistency\nRobustness against manipulations\n\nThe deeper down the authoritative chain a block is located:\n\nThe further in the past it was added\nThe more time has passed since its inclusion in the blockchain-data-structure\nThe more common effort has been spent on adding subsequent blocks\nThe less it is affected by random changes of the blocks that belong to the longest chain\nThe less likely it will be abandoned\nThe more accepted it is by the nodes of the system\nThe more anchored it is in the common history of the nodes\n\nThe fact that certainty concerning the inclusion of blocks in the authoritative chain increases as time goes by and as more blocks are added eventually is called eventually consistency.\nA 51 percent attack is an attempt to gather or control the majority of the whole voting power in a collective decision-making process with the goal to turn blocks that are part of the authoritative chain into orphan blocks and establish a new authoritative chain that contains a transaction history that is more favorable from the attackers point of view.\nA 51 percent attack has the following characteristics:\n\nEconomically: Changing the allocation of ownership rights by changing the collective history of transaction data.\nDecision making: Gathering the majority of voting power in order to enforce a desired result.\nTechnically: Undermining the integrity of the system.\nArchitecturally: Establish at least temporarily a hidden element of centrality that changes the state of the system.\n\n\n\n\nStep 20: Paying for Integrity\n\nThe blockchain utilizes fees for compensating its peers for contributing to the integrity of the system.\nThe instrument of payment used to compensate peers has an impact on major aspects of the blockchain such as:\n\nIntegrity\nOpenness\nThe distributed nature\nThe philosophy of the system\nDesirable properties of an instrument of payment for compensating peers are:\nBeing available in digital form\nBeing accepted in the real world\nBeing accepted in all countries\nNot being the subject to capital movement restrictions\nBeing trustworthy\nNot being controlled by one single central organization or state\n\nA cryptocurrency is an independent digital currency whose ownership is managed by a blockchain that uses it as an instrument of payment for compensating its peers for maintaining the integrity of the system.\n\n\n\nStep 21: Bringing the pieces together\n\nThe blockchain is a purely distributed peer-to-peer system that addresses the following aspects of managing ownership:\n\nDescribing ownership: History of Transaction Data\nProtecting ownership: Digital Signature\nStoring transaction data: Blockchain-Data-Structure\nPreparing ledgers for being distributed: Immutability\nDistributing ledgers: Gossip-Style Information Forwarding Through a Network\nProcessing new transactions: Blockchain-Algorithm\nDeciding which ledger represents the truth: Distributed Consensus\n\nAnalyzing the blockchain involves the following aspects:\n\nThe application goal\nIts properties\nIts internal functioning\n\nThe blockchain has two application goals:\n\nClarifying ownership\nTransferring ownership\n\nThe blockchain fulfills its application goals while exhibiting the following qualities:\n\nHighly available\nCensorship proof\nReliable\nOpen\nPseudoanonymous\nSecure\nResilient\nEventually consistent\nKeeping integrity\n\nInternally the blockchain consists of components that are either specific or agnostic to the application goal of managing ownership.\nThe application-specific components of the blockchain are:\n\nOwnership logic\nTransaction data\nTransaction processing logic\nTransaction security\n\nThe application-agnostic components are:\n\nThe blockchain-technology-suite\nThe purely distributed peer-to-peer architecture\n\nThe blockchain-technology-suite consists of:\n\nStorage logic\nConsensus logic\nData processing logic\nAsymmetric cryptography\n\n\n\n\n\nStage 4: Limitations and how to overcome them\n\nStep 22: Seeing the limitations\n\nThe openness of the blockchain and the absence of any form of central control are the fundamentals of its functioning but can also cause limitations for its adoption.\nMajor technical limitations of the blockchain are:\n\nLack of privacy\nThe security model\nLimited scalability\nHigh costs\nHidden centrality\nLack of flexibility\nCritical size\n\nThe most important nontechnical limitations of the blockchain are:\n\nLack of legal acceptance\nLack of user acceptance\nTechnical limitations of the blockchain can be overcome by improving the existing technology or by introducing conceptual changes.\nThe nontechnical limitations of the blockchain can be overcome by educational and legislative initiatives.\n\n\n\n\nStep 23: Reinventing the Blockchain\n\nThe blockchain inherently contains the following conflicts:\n\nTransparency vs.¬†privacy: On the one hand, transparency is needed for clarifying ownership and preventing double spending, but on the other hand, its users require privacy.\nSecurity vs.¬†speed: On the one hand, protecting the history of transaction data from being manipulated is done by utilizing the computationally expensive proof of work, but on the other hand, speed and scalability are required in most commercial contexts.\n\nThe transparency vs.¬†privacy conflict has its root in the allocation of reading access rights to the blockchain-data-structure.\nThe security vs.¬†speed conflict has its root in the allocation of writing access rights to the blockchain-data-structure.\nSolving the transparency vs.¬†privacy conflict led to the following versions of the blockchain:\n\nPublic blockchains grant reading access and the right to create new transactions to all users or nodes.\nPrivate blockchains limit reading access and the right to create new transactions to a preselected group of users or nodes.\n\nSolving the security vs.¬†speed conflict led to the following versions of the blockchain:\n\nPermissionless blockchains grant writing access to everyone. Every user or node can verify transaction data and create and add new blocks to the blockchain-data-structure.\nPermissioned blockchains grant writing access only to a limited group of preselected nodes or users that are identified as trustworthy through an on-boarding process.\n\nCombining these restrictions pairwise led to the emergence of four different kinds of blockchains.\nRestricting reading or writing access results in consequences on the following properties of the blockchain:\n\nThe peer-to-peer architecture\nThe distributed nature\nIts purpose\n\nThe blockchain-technology-suite causes value even in restricted environments for the following reasons:\n\nThe number of nodes can vary due to technical failures or downtime.\nEvery distributed system faces the adversaries of networks that make communication on the level of individual messages unreliable.\nEven an on-boarding process may not guarantee the trustworthiness of nodes at a 100 percent level.\nEven trustworthy nodes may yield wrong results due to technical failures.\n\n\n\n\n\nStage 5: Using the Blockchain, Summary and Outlook\n\nStep 24: Using the Blockchain\n\nThe blockchain can be considered a purely distributed data store with additional properties such as being immutable, append-only, ordered, time-stamped, and eventually consistent.\nBeing a generic data store means that the blockchain can store a wide range of data, which in turn makes it usable in a wide range of application areas.\nBased on its properties, we can identify the following generic-use patterns of the blockchain:\n\nProof of existence\nProof of nonexistence\nProof of time\nProof of order\nProof of identity\nProof of authorship\nProof of ownership\n\nSpecific application areas of the blockchain that have already received attention or may receive attention in the future are:\n\nPayments\nCryptocurrencies\nMicropayments\nDigital assets\nDigital identity\nNotary services\nCompliance and audit\nTax\nVoting\nRecord management\n\nWhen analyzing specific blockchain applications or blockchain services, some questions need to be answered:\n\nWhat kind of blockchain is used?\nAre the requirements for using the blockchain fulfilled?\nWhat is the added value of using a purely distributed peer-to-peer system?\nWhat is the application idea?\nWhat is the business case?\nHow are peers compensated for contributing resources to the system?\n\n\n\n\nStep 25: Summarizing and going further\n\nThe blockchain has been and will continue to be the subject of further improvements and developments such as variations in its implementation, improving efficiency, improving scalability, and conceptual advances.\nSmart contracts, zero-knowledge proofs, and alternative ways to achieve consensus are major areas of conceptual advancement of the blockchain.\nBesides it technical merits, the blockchain may be honored for the following long-term accomplishments:\n\nDisintermediation\nAutomation\nStandardization\nStreamlining processes\nIncreased processing speed\nCost reduction\nShift toward trust in protocols and technology\nMaking trust a commodity\nIncreased technology awareness\n\nPossible disadvantages of the blockchain are:\n\nLack of privacy\nLoss of personal responsibility\nLoss of jobs\nReintermediation\n\nPossible usages of the blockchain to be seen in the future are:\n\nLimited enthusiast projects\nLarge-scale commercial projects\nGovernmental projects"

Noah lets the reader see what it was like growing up poor and black in South Africa but always showing the humanity of the people he came into contact with.\nPublisher‚Äôs Description: ‚Äú#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER ‚Ä¢ More than one million copies sold! A ‚Äúbrilliant‚Äù (Lupita Nyong‚Äôo, Time), ‚Äúpoignant‚Äù (Entertainment Weekly), ‚Äúsoul-nourishing‚Äù (USA Today) memoir about coming of age during the twilight of apartheid ‚ÄúNoah‚Äôs childhood stories are told with all the hilarity and intellect that characterizes his comedy, while illuminating a dark and brutal period in South Africa‚Äôs history that must never be forgotten.‚Äù‚ÄîEsquire Winner of the Thurber Prize for American Humor and an NAACP Image Award ‚Ä¢ Named one of the best books of the year by The New York Time, USA Today, San Francisco Chronicle, NPR, Esquire, Newsday, and Booklist Trevor Noah‚Äôs unlikely path from apartheid South Africa to the desk of The Daily Show began with a criminal act: his birth. Trevor was born to a white Swiss father and a black Xhosa mother at a time when such a union was punishable by five years in prison. Living proof of his parents‚Äô indiscretion, Trevor was kept mostly indoors for the earliest years of his life, bound by the extreme and often absurd measures his mother took to hide him from a government that could, at any moment, steal him away. Finally liberated by the end of South Africa‚Äôs tyrannical white rule, Trevor and his mother set forth on a grand adventure, living openly and freely and embracing the opportunities won by a centuries-long struggle. Born a Crime is the story of a mischievous young boy who grows into a restless young man as he struggles to find himself in a world where he was never supposed to exist. It is also the story of that young man‚Äôs relationship with his fearless, rebellious, and fervently religious mother‚Äîhis teammate, a woman determined to save her son from the cycle of poverty, violence, and abuse that would ultimately threaten her own life. The stories collected here are by turns hilarious, dramatic, and deeply affecting. Whether subsisting on caterpillars for dinner during hard times, being thrown from a moving car during an attempted kidnapping, or just trying to survive the life-and-death pitfalls of dating in high school, Trevor illuminates his curious world with an incisive wit and unflinching honesty. His stories weave together to form a moving and searingly funny portrait of a boy making his way through a damaged world in a dangerous time, armed only with a keen sense of humor and a mother‚Äôs unconventional, unconditional love.‚Äù"

This is a quintessentially American disease - Europeans dont seem to suffer from it to the same extent. As for the rest of the world - well this is very much a first-world problem. Somehow over the years, the houses I have lived in have gotten bigger and the amount of stuff has grown to fill them. A reluctance to throw things away (just in case I might need it at some point in the future) means that my basement is full of boxes with the contents rotting away - well, not literally rotting away ‚Ä¶ ok, maybe in some cases literally rotting away. - (With a potential move to the UK looming, and with it the strong likelihood of having to downsize our family‚Äôs living accomodations, I thought this book would inspire me to do something about all my stuff and provide practical tips on how to do so. To some extent it did do that, but I found the book to be way too repetitive to be enjoyable. The material would make a great TedTalk or a long blog post, but as a book it was a chore to get through to the end.\nNote that the author is (I think) a Christian Pastor of some sort, and the book is sprinkled with biblical and religious references. I wasn‚Äôt bothered by it, but if that sort of thing rubs your the wrong way then it‚Äôs something to be aware of. Having said all that, I was convinced by the basic idea of a minimalist lifestyle. Now I just need to convince my wife :-)"

In general, I found technical books don‚Äôt work so well on the Kindle, even when viewed in the Kindle app on an iPad - perhaps it‚Äôs something to do with the mobi format. My preference is to purchase technical books direct from the publisher - in this case Manning, although I‚Äôve also purchased from O‚ÄôReilly, The Pragmatic Bookshelf, Pakt and others. One benefit is that the books are typically DRM free and available in multiple formats - e.g.¬†PDF for viewing on a laptop, ePub for viewing on an iPad. Both the PDF and ePub formats seem to be closer the mobi format to the typesetting and layout you would get in a printed book. - (I‚Äôm not entirely sure what inspired me to purchase this book - I‚Äôm not, in general, a very artsy person. I guess it‚Äôs the idea that we can use algorithms to create something aesthetically pleasing. I learned a lot from this book, even though I have singularly failed to take what I learnt and actually try and create some art. At least I have a better understanding of how to go about it if I decide to give it a go somewhere down the line.\nThe book is composed of three parts. Part one looks at the overall concept of generative art and introduces the Processing platform which is the tool through will all the techniques in the book are implemented. Processing is a pretty cool platform for visualization - the Processing language is a variant of Java. However, there is now a Python mode for Processing - I generally tried to translate the code in the book to the Python version. Part 2 is about randomness and noise. The ‚Äòaha moment‚Äô for me here was understanding that perfectly straight lines and round circles are not as aesthetically pleasing as those produced by injecting a little noise into the process. Part 3 is about complexity and looks at emergence, autonomy and fractals. Overall a good read and an interesting diversion from enterprise programming."

This might have had something to do with the fact that I listed to the audibook version which was narrated by the author himself. Perhaps a more experienced narrator could have put a bit more life into it.\nI think it was worth a read/listen and definitely gives you some insight into what it feels like to live in a war-torn middle-eastern country before veering off onto a more surreal path with the premise that portals appear all over the world connecting the third-world to the first.\nFor me the novel appealed on an intellectual level but rarely on an emotional level."

As a retired brain surgeon, Henry Marsh thought he understood illness, but he was unprepared for the impact of his diagnosis of advanced cancer. And Finally explores what happens when someone who has spent a lifetime on the frontline of life and death finds himself contemplating what might be his own death sentence. As he navigates the bewildering transition from doctor to patient, he is haunted by past failures and projects yet to be completed, and frustrated by the inconveniences of illness and old age. But he is also more entranced than ever by the mysteries of science and the brain, the beauty of the natural world and his love for his family. Elegiac, candid, luminous and poignant, And Finally is ultimately not so much a book about death, but a book about life and what matters in the end."

More family soon followed, and the clan has been here ever since. Funny in Farsi chronicles the American journey of Dumas‚Äôs wonderfully engaging family: her engineer father, a sweetly quixotic dreamer who first sought riches on Bowling for Dollars and in Las Vegas, and later lost his job during the Iranian revolution; her elegant mother, who never fully mastered English (nor cared to); her uncle, who combated the effects of American fast food with an army of miraculous American weight-loss gadgets; and Firoozeh herself, who as a girl changed her name to Julie, and who encountered a second wave of culture shock when she met and married a Frenchman, becoming part of a one-couple melting pot. In a series of deftly drawn scenes, we watch the family grapple with American English (hot dogs and hush puppies?‚Äîa complete mystery), American traditions (Thanksgiving turkey?‚Äîan even greater mystery, since it tastes like nothing), and American culture (Firoozeh‚Äôs parents laugh uproariously at Bob Hope on television, although they don‚Äôt get the jokes even when she translates them into Farsi).

All around us are people who feel invisible, unseen, misunderstood. In How to Know a Person, Brooks sets out to help us do better, posing questions that are essential for all of us: If you want to know a person, what kind of attention should you cast on them? What kind of conversations should you have? What parts of a person‚Äôs story should you pay attention to? Driven by his trademark sense of curiosity and his determination to grow as a person, Brooks draws from the fields of psychology and neuroscience and from the worlds of theater, philosophy, history, and education to present a welcoming, hopeful, integrated approach to human connection. How to Know a Person helps readers become more understanding and considerate toward others, and to find the joy that comes from being seen. Along the way it offers a possible remedy for a society that is riven by fragmentation, hostility, and misperception. The act of seeing another person, Brooks argues, is profoundly creative: How can we look somebody in the eye and see something large in them, and in turn, see something larger in ourselves? How to Know a Person is for anyone searching for connection, and yearning to be understood."

I say ‚Äúintroductory‚Äù because the book covers a lot of ground and aims for breadth rather than depth. In many ways the book is a field guide to all the non-technical aspects of what software developer does. Although it introduces a host of theories and mental models, this is a very practical book with a host of actionable tips in each chapter of what to do or not to do.\nDespite being most useful for early career developers, even more seasoned professionals can gain valuable tips and insights from the book.

Now out in paperback, Matterhorn is an epic war novel in the tradition of Norman Mailer‚Äôs The Naked and the Dead and James Jones‚Äôs The Thin Red Line. It is the timeless story of a young Marine lieutenant, Waino Mellas, and his comrades in Bravo Company, who are dropped into the mountain jungle of Vietnam as boys and forced to fight their way into manhood. Standing in their way are not merely the North Vietnamese but also monsoon rain and mud, leeches and tigers, disease and malnutrition. Almost as daunting, it turns out, are the obstacles they discover between each other: racial tension, competing ambitions, and duplicitous superior officers. But when the company finds itself surrounded and outnumbered by a massive enemy regiment, the Marines are thrust into the raw and all- consuming terror of combat. The experience will change them forever. Matterhorn is a visceral and spellbinding novel about what it is like to be a young man at war. It is an unforgettable novel that transforms the tragedy of Vietnam into a powerful and universal story of courage, camaraderie, and sacrifice: a parable not only of the war in Vietnam but of all war, and a testament to the redemptive power of literature."

David Marquet\n\n\nisbn-13: 9780735217539\nAudible\nPublisher‚Äôs Description\nWall Street Journal Bestseller From the acclaimed author of Turn the Ship Around!, former US Navy Captain David Marquet, comes a radical new playbook for empowering your team to make better decisions and take greater ownership. You might imagine that an effective leader is someone who makes quick, intelligent decisions, gives inspiring speeches, and issues clear orders to their team so they can execute a plan to achieve your organization‚Äôs goals. Unfortunately, David Marquet argues, that‚Äôs an outdated model of leadership that just doesn‚Äôt work anymore. As a leader in today‚Äôs networked, information-dense business climate, you don‚Äôt have full visibility into your organization or the ground reality of your operating environment. In order to harness the eyes, ears, and minds of your people, you need to foster a climate of collaborative experimentation that encourages people to speak up when they notice problems and work together to identify and test solutions. Too many leaders fall in love with the sound of their own voice, and wind up dictating plans and digging in their heels when problems begin to emerge. Even when you want to be a more collaborative leader, you can undermine your own efforts by defaulting to command-and-control language we‚Äôve inherited from the industrial era. It‚Äôs time to ditch the industrial age playbook of leadership. In Leadership is Language, you‚Äôll learn how choosing your words can dramatically improve decision-making and execution on your team. Marquet outlines six plays for all leaders, anchored in how you use language: ‚Ä¢ Control the clock, don‚Äôt obey the clock: Pre-plan decision points and give your people the tools they need to hit pause on a plan of action if they notice something wrong. ‚Ä¢ Collaborate, don‚Äôt coerce: As the leader, you should be the last one to offer your opinion. Rather than locking your team into binary responses (‚ÄúIs this a good plan?‚Äù), allow them to answer on a scale (‚ÄúHow confident are you about this plan?‚Äù) ‚Ä¢ Commit, don‚Äôt comply: Rather than expect your team to comply with specific directions, explain your overall goals, and get their commitment to achieving it one piece at a time. ‚Ä¢ Complete, not continue: If every day feels like a repetition of the last, you‚Äôre doing something wrong. Articulate concrete plans with a start and end date to align your team. ‚Ä¢ Improve, don‚Äôt prove: Ask your people to improve on plans and processes, rather than prove that they can meet fixed goals or deadlines. You‚Äôll face fewer cut corners and better long-term results. ‚Ä¢ Connect, don‚Äôt conform: Flatten hierarchies in your organization and connect with your people to encourage them to contribute to decision- making. In his last book, Turn the Ship Around!, Marquet told the incredible story of abandoning command-and-control leadership on his submarine and empowering his crew to turn the worst performing submarine to the best performer in the fleet. Now, with Leadership is Language he gives businesspeople the tools they need to achieve such transformational leadership in their organizations."

So often in life, we get stuck in a cycle of response. We put out fires. We deal with emergencies. We stay downstream, handling one problem after another, but we never make our way upstream to fix the systems that caused the problems. Cops chase robbers, doctors treat patients with chronic illnesses, and call-center reps address customer complaints. But many crimes, chronic illnesses, and customer complaints are preventable. So why do our efforts skew so heavily toward reaction rather than prevention? Upstream probes the psychological forces that push us downstream‚Äîincluding ‚Äúproblem blindness,‚Äù which can leave us oblivious to serious problems in our midst. And Heath introduces us to the thinkers who have overcome these obstacles and scored massive victories by switching to an upstream mindset. One online travel website prevented twenty million customer service calls every year by making some simple tweaks to its booking system. A major urban school district cut its dropout rate in half after it figured out that it could predict which students would drop out‚Äîas early as the ninth grade. A European nation almost eliminated teenage alcohol and drug abuse by deliberately changing the nation‚Äôs culture. And one EMS system accelerated the emergency-response time of its ambulances by using data to predict where 911 calls would emerge‚Äîand forward-deploying its ambulances to stand by in those areas. Upstream delivers practical solutions for preventing problems rather than reacting to them. How many problems in our lives and in society are we tolerating simply because we‚Äôve forgotten that we can fix them?‚Äù"

In revealing the science of great performance and the stories of great performers across a wide range of capabilities, Peak Performance uncovers the secrets of success, and coaches you on how to use them.

According to the book, long-lasting success accrues to givers more than to takers or matchers.

The novel also introduced a character who I‚Äôm hoping will be the Professor Moriarity to Isaiah‚Äôs Sherlock. This second book in the series does not disappoint."

Of roads taken and then abandoned, of enthusiasms. In the effort to imagine what has not yet been imagined‚Äù\n\npage 38\n\n‚ÄúWhen his great Italian friend Michele Besso died, Einstein wrote a moving letter to Michele‚Äôs sister: Michele has left this strange world a little before me. This means nothing. People like us, who believe in physics, know that the distinction made between past, present and future is nothing more than a persistent, stubborn illusion.‚Äô‚Äù\n\npage 58\nPublisher‚Äôs Description: ‚ÄúIn this short, playful, entertaining and mind-bending introduction to modern physics, Rovelli explains Einstein‚Äôs theory of general relativity, quantum mechanics, black holes, the complex architecture of the universe, elementary particles, gravity, and the nature of the mind. In under one hundred pages, readers will understand the most transformative scientific discoveries of the twentieth century.‚Äù"

    "text": "All Our Wrong Todays by Elan Mastai\n\n\nisbn-13: 9781101985137\nAudible\nI‚Äôm a sucker for time-travel books and this is one of two great time-travel books I‚Äôve read this year - the other being A Gift of Time. Both of them take some effort to think through (in their own ways) some of the practical questions around time travel - e.g.¬†do your clothes travel with you? what if you materialize into a solid object? etc.\nAll Our Wrong Todays is the jokier of the two, but has its more profound moments too. I was particularly intrigued by the author‚Äôs reference to French philosopher Paul Virilio‚Äôs idea of the ‚Äúintegral accident‚Äù.\nA quote from the book:\n\nCat‚Äôs Cradle is about a lot of things, but a major plot thread involves the invention of ice-nine, a substance that freezes everything it touches, which falls out of its creator‚Äôs control and destroys all life on the planet.\nLionel Goettreider read Cat‚Äôs Cradle and had a crucial realization, what he called the ‚ÄúAccident‚Äù‚Äî when you invent a new technology, you also invent the accident of that technology.\nWhen you invent the car, you also invent the car accident. When you invent the plane, you also invent the plane crash. When you invent nuclear fission, you also invent the nuclear meltdown. When you invent ice-nine, you also invent unintentionally freezing the planet solid.\nWhen Lionel Goettreider invented the Goettreider Engine, he knew he couldn‚Äôt turn it on until he figured out its accident‚Äîand how to prevent it.\n\nPublisher‚Äôs Description: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no such thing as the life you‚Äôre‚Äùsupposed‚Äù to have‚Ä¶ You know the future that people in the 1950s imagined we‚Äôd have? Well, it happened. In Tom Barren‚Äôs 2016, humanity thrives in a techno-utopian paradise of flying cars, moving sidewalks, and moon bases, where avocados never go bad and punk rock never existed . . . because it wasn‚Äôt necessary. Except Tom just can‚Äôt seem to find his place in this dazzling, idealistic world, and that‚Äôs before his life gets turned upside down. Utterly blindsided by an accident of fate, Tom makes a rash decision that drastically changes not only his own life but the very fabric of the universe itself. In a time-travel mishap, Tom finds himself stranded in our 2016, what we think of as the real world. For Tom, our normal reality seems like a dystopian wasteland. But when he discovers wonderfully unexpected versions of his family, his career, and‚Äìmaybe, just maybe‚Äìhis soul mate, Tom has a decision to make. Does he fix the flow of history, bringing his utopian universe back into existence, or does he try to forge a new life in our messy, unpredictable reality? Tom‚Äôs search for the answer takes him across countries, continents, and timelines in a quest to figure out, finally, who he really is and what his future‚Äìour future‚Äìis supposed to be. All Our Wrong Todays is about the versions of ourselves that we shed and grow into over time. It is a story of friendship and family, of unexpected journeys and alternate paths, and of love in its multitude of forms. Filled with humor and heart, and saturated with insight and intelligence and a mind-bending talent for invention, this novel signals the arrival of a major talent.‚Äù"

We‚Äôve lost our grip on what we really want and who we really want to be. In order to solve the challenges of chaos and make our goals, dreams, and commitments a reality, we have to understand that in order to succeed when the pressure is on and to improve our performance overall, we‚Äôve got to know what we can and cannot control. In Span of Control, Lohrenz walks us through the fundamentals of surviving and succeeding during times of crisis.

    "text": "Algorithms to live by by Brian Christian\n\n\nisbn-13: 9781627790369\nKindle\n‚ÄúA fascinating exploration of how insights from computer algorithms can be applied to our everyday lives, helping to solve common decision-making problems and illuminate the workings of the human mind All our lives are constrained by limited space and time, limits that give rise to a particular set of problems. What should we do, or leave undone, in a day or a lifetime? How much messiness should we accept? What balance of new activities and familiar favorites is the most fulfilling? These may seem like uniquely human quandaries, but they are not: computers, too, face the same constraints, so computer scientists have been grappling with their version of such issues for decades. And the solutions they‚Äôve found have much to teach us. In a dazzlingly interdisciplinary work, acclaimed author Brian Christian and cognitive scientist Tom Griffiths show how the algorithms used by computers can also untangle very human questions. They explain how to have better hunches and when to leave things to chance, how to deal with overwhelming choices and how best to connect with others. From finding a spouse to finding a parking spot, from organizing one‚Äôs inbox to understanding the workings of memory, Algorithms to Live By transforms the wisdom of computer science into strategies for human living.‚Äù"

New from the author of Slow Horses, now an Apple Original series from Apple TV+, starring Gary Oldman and Kristin Scott Thomas. Two years ago, a hostile Prime Minister launched the Monochrome inquiry, investigating ‚Äúhistorical over-reaching‚Äù by the British Secret Service. Monochrome‚Äôs mission was to ferret out any hint of misconduct by any MI5 officer‚Äîand allowed Griselda Fleet and Malcolm Kyle, the two civil servants seconded to the project, unfettered access to any and all confidential information in the Service archives in order to do so. But MI5‚Äôs formidable First Desk did not become Britain‚Äôs top spy by accident, and she has successfully thwarted the inquiry at every turn. Now the administration that created Monochrome has been ousted, the investigation is a total bust‚Äîand Griselda and Malcolm are stuck watching as their career prospects are washed away by the pounding London rain. Until the eve of Monochrome‚Äôs shuttering, when an MI5 case file appears without explanation. It is the buried history of a classified operation in 1994 Berlin‚Äîan operation that ended in tragedy and scandal, whose cover-up has rewritten thirty years of Service history. The Secret Hours is a dazzling entry point into Mick Herron‚Äôs body of work, a standalone spy thriller that is at once unnerving, poignant, and laugh-out- loud funny. It is also the breathtaking secret history that Slough House fans have been waiting for."

My only concerns in life were how to avoid a transfer to the Case Progression Unit - we do paperwork so real coppers don‚Äôt have to - and finding a way to climb into the panties of the outrageously perky WPC Leslie May.

Domain-specific Knowledge Graph Construction (KGC) is an active research area that has recently witnessed impressive advances due to machine learning techniques like deep neural networks and word embeddings. This book will synthesize Knowledge Graph Construction over Web Data in an engaging and accessible manner. The book will describe a timely topic for both early -and mid-career researchers. Every year, more papers continue to be published on knowledge graph construction, especially for difficult Web domains. This work would serve as a useful reference, as well as an accessible but rigorous overview of this body of work. The book will present interdisciplinary connections when possible to engage researchers looking for new ideas or synergies. This will allow the book to be marketed in multiple venues and conferences. The book will also appeal to practitioners in industry and data scientists since it will have chapters on both data collection, as well as a chapter on querying and off-the-shelf implementations. The author has, and continues to, present on this topic at large and important conferences. He plans to make the powerpoint he presents available as a supplement to the work. This will draw a natural audience for the book. Some of the reviewers are unsure about his position in the community but that seems to be more a function of his age rather than his relative expertise. I agree with some of the reviewers that the title is a little complicated. I would recommend ‚ÄúDomain Specific Knowledge Graphs‚Äù.‚Äù"

I was reading about Bayes Rule and stumbled across the essay An Intuitive Explanation of Bayes‚Äô Theorem. From there I found the LessWrong website which had a link intriguingly entitled The Methods of Rationality. After a little more research I found the hpmor.com website and downloaded an epub version of the book.\nThe premise of the book is an alternate Harry Potter reality where rather than being raised by a cruel and ignorant aunt and uncle, instead a highly educated aunt and uncle train him in the scientific method and they emphasize a highly rational approach to the world. When Harry is introduced to the world of magic it shakes his fundamental assumptions about how the universe works. Nevertheless, he sets out to understand this strange new world of magic using rational thinking and scientific methods.\nThis is a huge book with a word count of 661,619 - for reference, the total word count in JK Rowling‚Äôs Harry Potter series is 1,084,170. I personally found the quality of the writing and plot to be very high, with many genuinely exciting scenes. If you are a dyed-in-the-wool Harry Potter fan, be prepared for many of your character assumptions to be challenged or overturned. And if you‚Äôre a Ron Weasley fan, then don‚Äôt bother with this book.\nThere are certain viewpoints that the author, Eliezer Yudkowsky , asserts through the novel that I disagree with - in particular, the notion of death being the main enemy to overcome. Somehow, that seems a somewhat unjustifiable stand from a rational perspective.\nOverall, if you are science nerd but still enjoyed the original Harry Potter series, I think you‚Äôll love this alternate version."

In 2006, an oddball group of bankers, traders and brokers from some of the world‚Äôs largest financial institutions made a startling realization: Libor‚Äîthe London interbank offered rate, which determines interest rates on trillions in loans worldwide‚Äîwas set daily by a small group of easily manipulated functionaries. Tom Hayes, a brilliant but troubled mathematician, became the lynchpin of shadowy team that used hook and crook to take over the process and set rates that made them a fortune, no matter the cost to others. Among the motley crew was a French trader nicknamed ‚ÄúGollum‚Äù; the broker ‚ÄúAbbo,‚Äù who liked to publicly strip naked when drinking; a Kazakh chicken farmer turned something short of financial whiz kid; an executive called ‚ÄúClumpy‚Äù because of his patchwork hair loss; and a broker uncreatively nicknamed ‚ÄúBig Nose.‚Äù Eventually known as the ‚ÄúSpider Network,‚Äù Hayes‚Äôs circle generated untold riches ‚Äîuntil it all unraveled in spectacularly vicious, backstabbing fashion.

Most people wouldn‚Äôt expect an economist to have an answer to these questions‚Äìor to other questions of daily life, such as who to date or how early to leave for the airport. But those people haven‚Äôt met Allison Schrager, an economist and award-winning journalist who has spent her career examining how people manage risk in their lives and careers. Whether we realize it or not, we all take risks large and small every day. Even the most cautious among us cannot opt out‚Äì the question is always which risks to take, not whether to take them at all. What most of us don‚Äôt know is how to measure those risks and maximize the chances of getting what we want out of life. In An Economist Walks into a Brothel, Schrager equips readers with five principles for dealing with risk, principles used by some of the world‚Äôs most interesting risk takers. For instance, she interviews a professional poker player about how to stay rational when the stakes are high, a paparazzo in Manhattan about how to spot different kinds of risk, horse breeders in Kentucky about how to diversify risk and minimize losses, and a war general who led troops in Iraq about how to prepare for what we don‚Äôt see coming.

The story spends a good chunk of its time (no pun intended) in 1950‚Äôs and 60‚Äôs America - these parts of the book reminded me of Stephen King‚Äôs brilliant 11/22/63 in its atmospheric evocation of fifties Americana.\nThe ending was a bit meh, but still a tremendously enjoyable book overall.\nPublisher‚Äôs Description: ‚ÄúWhen Micajah Fenton discovers a crater in his front yard with a broken time glider in the bottom and a naked, virtual woman on his lawn, he delays his plans to kill himself.

Thorp\n\n\nisbn-13: 9781400067961\nAudible\nI read this after finishing ‚ÄúThe Man Who Solved The Market‚Äù about the founder of Renaissance Technologies‚Äô Jim Simons. It‚Äôs interesting to compare and contrast Thorp and Simons - both came from relatively modest backgrounds, studied mathematics eventually leading Maths departments (Thorp at UC Irvine and Simons at SUNY Stony Brook) before becoming Hedge Fund managers. Thorp is older than Simons by about 6 years but started in finance about 10 years prior to Simons, founding Princeton Newport Partners (PNP) in 1969, whereas Simons started the precursor to Rennaisance Technologies in 1978. Thorp is probably more well known due to his work in trying to beat the Las Vegas casinos at Blackjack, Bacarat and Roulette (using a wearable computer he created with the help of Claude Shannon). Simons is probably the more mathematically accomplished having won the Veblen Prize in Geometry and worked for the NSA cracking codes during the Cold War. While both were very succesful as Hedge Fund managers, Thorps wealth pales in comparison to Simons.\n‚ÄúA Man for All Markets‚Äù is an autobiography, whereas ‚ÄúThe Man Who Solved the Market‚Äù is a biography written by a financial journalist with minimal co-operation from Simons. It‚Äôs no surprise then that this reader came away liking Thorp much more than Simons. Thorp certainly seems to have a more well rounded view of life and what the truly important things in life are. He stepped away from managing other peoples to spend more time with family and doing things he enjoys whereas Simons seemed much more driven to acquire more and more wealth. But, it must be taken with a pinch of salt as an autobiography is always a somewhat sanitized view of a person‚Äôs life.\nOverall the book was worth reading, although the more personal early chapters were much more interesting than the later chapters which had more editorializing from Thorp about the financial markets.\nThe audiobook was narrated by Thorp himself, which in this case was not an advantage - his narration was slow (I sped it up to 1.2x) and with somewhat strange pauses in the sentences. Sometimes the author brings something extra to a narration, but here it would probably have been better to have a professional narrator.\nPublisher‚Äôs Description\nThe incredible true story of the card-counting mathematics professor who taught the world how to beat the dealer and, as the first of the great quantitative investors, ushered in a revolution on Wall Street. A child of the Great Depression, legendary mathematician Edward O. Thorp invented card counting, proving the seemingly impossible: that you could beat the dealer at the blackjack table. As a result he launched a gambling renaissance. His remarkable success‚Äîand mathematically unassailable method‚Äîcaused such an uproar that casinos altered the rules of the game to thwart him and the legions he inspired. They barred him from their premises, even put his life in jeopardy. Nonetheless, gambling was forever changed. Thereafter, Thorp shifted his sights to ‚Äúthe biggest casino in the world‚Äù: Wall Street. Devising and then deploying mathematical formulas to beat the market, Thorp ushered in the era of quantitative finance we live in today. Along the way, the so-called godfather of the quants played bridge with Warren Buffett, crossed swords with a young Rudy Giuliani, detected the Bernie Madoff scheme, and, to beat the game of roulette, invented, with Claude Shannon, the world‚Äôs first wearable computer. Here, for the first time, Thorp tells the story of what he did, how he did it, his passions and motivations, and the curiosity that has always driven him to disregard conventional wisdom and devise game-changing solutions to seemingly insoluble problems. An intellectual thrill ride, replete with practical wisdom that can guide us all in uncertain financial waters, A Man for All Markets is an instant classic‚Äîa book that challenges its readers to think logically about a seemingly irrational world. Praise for A Man for All Markets ‚ÄúIn A Man for All Markets, [Thorp] delightfully recounts his progress (if that is the word) from college teacher to gambler to hedge-fund manager. Along the way we learn important lessons about the functioning of markets and the logic of investment.‚Äù‚ÄîThe Wall Street Journal ‚Äú[Thorp] gives a biological summation (think Richard Feynman‚Äôs Surely You‚Äôre Joking, Mr.¬†Feynman!) of his quest to prove the aphorism ‚Äòthe house always wins‚Äô is flawed. . . . Illuminating for the mathematically inclined, and cautionary for would-be gamblers and day traders‚Äù‚Äî Library Journal"

He‚Äôs the narrator in the Audiobook version and like his last book Talking to Strangers he does a great job.\nA key difference between this book and his previous books is that Gladwell doesn‚Äôt have a central thesis that he tries to argue by threading together different stories. This is more of a linear telling of history, albeit with his usual cast of many characters.\nPublisher‚Äôs Description: ‚ÄúAn exploration of how technology and best intentions collide in the heat of war In The Bomber Mafia, Malcolm Gladwell weaves together the stories of a Dutch genius and his homemade computer, a band of brothers in central Alabama, a British psychopath, and pyromaniacal chemists at Harvard to examine one of the greatest moral challenges in modern American history. Most military thinkers in the years leading up to World War II saw the airplane as an afterthought. But a small band of idealistic strategists had a different view. This‚ÄùBomber Mafia‚Äù asked: What if precision bombing could, just by taking out critical choke points‚Äìindustrial or transportation hubs‚Äìcripple the enemy and make war far less lethal? In his podcast, Revisionist History, Gladwell reexamines moments from the past and asks whether we got it right the first time. In The Bomber Mafia, he steps back from the bombing of Tokyo on the deadliest night of the war and asks, ‚ÄúWas it worth it?‚Äù The attack was the brainchild of General Curtis LeMay, whose brutal pragmatism and scorched-earth tactics in Japan cost tens of thousands of civilian lives, but may have spared more by averting a planned US invasion. Things might have gone differently had LeMay‚Äôs predecessor, General Haywood Hansell, remained in charge. As a key member of the Bomber Mafia, Hansell believed in precision bombing, but his theories had been foiled by bad weather, enemy jet fighters, and human error. When he and Curtis LeMay squared off for a leadership handover in the jungles of Guam, LeMay emerged victorious, leading to the darkest night of World War II. The Bomber Mafia is a riveting tale of persistence, innovation, and the incalculable wages of war.‚Äù"

    "text": "Meditations by Marcus Aurelius\n\n\nI‚Äôve seen this book recommended many times by different people. I ended up getting the audiobook on Audible and backed it up with a Kindle version. The eBook is the Dover Thrift Edition - a modernized version of the George Long translation. I‚Äôm not entirely sure which translation is used in the audiobook. The narrator is pretty good but I found the density of the prose in the book required a level of concentration not typical when listening to audiobooks. There are a lot of ideas presented in the book requiring contemplation, but if you even briefly get distracted by your contemplations the audiobook has moved on. I think this why I generally prefer listen to fiction on audiobook rather than non-fiction, though I find history also seems to work well on audiobook.\nAs to Meditations, I understand now why so many have recommended this book. Marcus Aurelius was a Roman Emperor who ascended to the throne in 161 AD. This book contains his reflections on life and how to live it, based on the precepts of Stoicism, of which Aurelius was a disciple. Meditations is actually made of up 12 books. The first book is a list of people who have influenced his life and what he learnt from each. I found this to be very profound - the idea that there is something to be learnt from everyone that you interact with. It certainly got me thinking about the people who have influenced me and what I learnt from them - something I would like to put in to writing at some point in my life. The rest of the books are a series of meditations on various aspects of life. On first study, I couldn‚Äôt easily discern specific themes for each book though. This is a book to return to multiple times. I have read that the 2002 translation by Gregory Hays is more easily digestible, others recommend the 1964 transation by Maxwell Staniforth . There definitely seems to be a lot of variability between translations. I really liked the Stoic philosophy as presented in Meditations - I find a lot of congruence between it and the fundamental teachings of Islam, with one or two basic differences. The Serenity Prayer:\n\nGod, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, Courage to change the things I can, And wisdom to know the difference.\n\ncould easily be a succinct encapsulation of the philosophy presented in Meditations.\nA random quote from Meditations - Book VII, line 54:\n\nEverywhere and at all times it is in your power piously to acquiesce in your present condition, and to behave justly to those around you, and to exert your skill upon your present thoughts, that nothing shall steal into them without being well examined."

Organizational psychologist and executive coach Rebecca Newton has found that even her most successful clients still want more of one quality: gravitas. They want their words to carry weight, to have a positive, lasting impact on those around them. Gravitas can seem like an elusive, intangible quality, but it isn‚Äôt about adopting the style of another or being someone you‚Äôre not. Newton draws on extensive research and experience coaching business leaders to show what underpins authentic gravitas and how anyone can develop it. She presents the counterintuitive idea that in order to be valued, we shouldn‚Äôt spend all our time and energy trying to stand out from the crowd; instead, we should focus on the crowd‚Äìconnecting with others and understanding their needs in order to make a significant difference. Newton debunks the myths of gravitas and gives readers the practical tools to develop it by:  Minimizing the gaps between intention, action, and impact  Remaining true to yourself while adapting to work successfully with people who have different styles * Choosing to be courageous regardless of how confident you feel‚Äìas you engage in courageous behaviors, confidence naturally builds Authentic gravitas extends beyond commanding presence in the room during a key meeting; it‚Äôs about the small things you can do beforehand, during, and in all the spaces in between‚Äìto be someone who genuinely adds substantive value in the workplace and beyond."

He warned of the perils ahead, ending his note, ‚Äúin the name of God, let Palestine be left alone.‚Äù Thus Rashid Khalidi, al-Khalidi‚Äôs great-great- nephew, begins this sweeping history, the first general account of the conflict told from an explicitly Palestinian perspective. Drawing on a wealth of untapped archival materials and the reports of generations of family members‚Äîmayors, judges, scholars, diplomats, and journalists‚ÄîThe Hundred Years‚Äô War on Palestine upends accepted interpretations of the conflict, which tend, at best, to describe a tragic clash between two peoples with claims to the same territory. Instead, Khalidi traces a hundred years of colonial war on the Palestinians, waged first by the Zionist movement and then Israel, but backed by Britain and the United States, the great powers of the age. He highlights the key episodes in this colonial campaign, from the 1917 Balfour Declaration to the destruction of Palestine in 1948, from Israel‚Äôs 1982 invasion of Lebanon to the endless and futile peace process. Original, authoritative, and important, The Hundred Years‚Äô War on Palestine is not a chronicle of victimization, nor does it whitewash the mistakes of Palestinian leaders or deny the emergence of national movements on both sides. In reevaluating the forces arrayed against the Palestinians, it offers an illuminating new view of a conflict that continues to this day."

Perhaps it was because the first two were mysteries of a sort whereas this is more of a family drama. There is a mystery to be revealed here as well, but it‚Äôs all reasonably predictable.\nPublisher‚Äôs Description: ‚ÄúIn this‚Äùcompelling, bighearted, emotionally precise page-turner‚Äù (Sunday Times), the New York Times bestselling writer and acclaimed television host explores the aftermath of a tragedy on a small-town to illuminate the shame and longing that can flow through generations‚Äìand how the secrets of the heart cannot stay be buried forever. It is 1987 and a small Irish community is preparing for a wedding. The day before the ceremony, a group of young friends, including the bride and groom, are involved in an accident. Three survive. Three are killed. The lives of the families are shattered and the rifts between them ripple throughout the small town. Connor survived, but living among the angry and the mourning is almost as hard as carrying the shame of having been the driver. He leaves the only place he knows for another life, taking his secrets with him. Travelling first to Liverpool, then London, he eventually makes a home‚Äìof sorts‚Äìfor himself in New York, where he finds shelter and the possibility of forging a new life. But the secrets‚Äìthe unspoken longings and regrets that have come to haunt those left behind‚Äìwill not be silenced. Before long, Connor will have to confront his past. A powerful and timely novel of emigration and return, Home Stretch demonstrates Norton‚Äôs keen understanding of the power of stigma and secrecy‚Äìand their devastating effect on ordinary lives.‚Äù"

Why is Miami‚Ä¶Miami? What does the heartbreaking fate of the cheetah tell us about the way we raise our children? Why do Ivy League schools care so much about sports? What is the Magic Third, and what does it mean for racial harmony? In this provocative new work, Malcolm Gladwell returns for the first time in twenty-five years to the subject of social epidemics and tipping points, this time with the aim of explaining the dark side of contagious phenomena. Through a series of riveting stories, Gladwell traces the rise of a new and troubling form of social engineering. He takes us to the streets of Los Angeles to meet the world‚Äôs most successful bank robbers, rediscovers a forgotten television show from the 1970s that changed the world, visits the site of a historic experiment on a tiny cul- de-sac in northern California, and offers an alternate history of two of the biggest epidemics of our day: COVID and the opioid crisis. Revenge of the Tipping Point is Gladwell‚Äôs most personal book yet. With his characteristic mix of storytelling and social science, he offers a guide to making sense of the contagions of modern world. It‚Äôs time we took tipping points seriously."

Then, in the summer of ‚Äú2020‚Äù, he‚Äôs assigned to a grotesque murder case that brings national media focus to rural Patrick County, Virginia‚ÄìAlicia Benson, the wife of a wealthy businessman, is murdered in her home. The accused killer, Damian Bullins, is a cunning felon with a long history of violence, and he confesses to the police. He even admits his guilt to Andy. But a simple typographical error and a shocking discovery begin to complicate the state‚Äôs case, making it possible Bullins might escape punishment.

In 1942, Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse - mathematical genius and young Captain in the U.S. Navy - is assigned to detachment 2702. It is an outfit so secret that only a handful of people know it exists, and some of those people have names like Churchill and Roosevelt. The mission of Watrehouse and Detatchment 2702-commanded by Marine Raider Bobby Shaftoe-is to keep the Nazis ignorant of the fact that Allied Intelligence has cracked the enemy‚Äôs fabled Enigma code. It is a game, a cryptographic chess match between Waterhouse and his German counterpart, translated into action by the gung-ho Shaftoe and his forces. Fast-forward to the present, where Waterhouse‚Äôs crypto-hacker grandson, Randy, is attempting to create a‚Äùdata haven‚Äù in Southeast Asia - a place where encrypted data can be stored and exchanged free of repression and scrutiny. As governments and multinationals attack the endeavor, Randy joins forces with Shaftoe‚Äôs tough-as-nails grandaughter, Amy, to secretly salvage a sunken Nazi sumarine that holds the key to keeping the dream of a data haven afloat. But soon their scheme brings to light a massive conspiracy with its roots in Detachment 2702 linked to an unbreakable Nazi code called Arethusa. And it will represent the path to unimaginable riches and a future of personal and digital liberty‚Ä¶or to universal totalitarianism reborn. A breathtaking tour de force, and Neal Stephenson‚Äôs most accomplished and affecting work to date, CRYPTONOMICON is profound and prophetic, hypnotic and hyper-driven, as it leaps forward and back between World War II and the World Wide Web, hinting all the while at a dark day- after-tomorrow. It is a work of great art, thought, and creative daring; the product of a truly icon‚Äù"

Almost everything I ‚Äúread‚Äù in the second half of 2020 was actually an audiobook, the only exceptions being The Holy Quran and Malfuzat which were hardcovers.\nDavid Quammen produced probably the most memorable read of the second half of the year (as he did the first half with Spillover) in The Reluctant Mr.¬†Darwin. Not a complete biography of Darwin as it only covers his life after his adventures on the HMS Beagle, but it helps put the theory of evolution in proper historical context. I certainly learn a lot from it.\nThe Hate U Give was a timely read given the events of the summer with the Black Lives Matter movement. Although categorized as a ‚Äúyoung adult‚Äù novel this far-from-young adult found it enjoyable and thought-provoking.\nOrconomics and its follow-up Son Of A Liche were my first forays into LitRPG. Never having played D&D or its ilk, I wasn‚Äôt up to speed with all the conventions of the genre - nevertheless I found both books enjoyable and funny. While following the typical fantasy story conventions the books are also an effective satire on capitalism , modern day finance and the housing crash (Collateralized Threat Obligations play a big role in the plot of the second book!)\nStorm Front was a strong recommendation from a friend - a combination of mystery and magical fantasy. While I enjoyed it, the opportunity costs involved mean I will probably skip investing time into the remaining 16+ novels in the series (at least for now).\nOn the non-fiction front Think Like a Rocket Scientist and Workplace Poker were useful but not essential reads, while An Economist Walks Into A Brother was disappointing."

    "text": "My Favorite Non-Fiction Reads of 2022\n\nBoyd - The Fighter Pilot Who Changed The Art Of War by Robert Coram: John Boyd is probably up there in list of most influential Americans of the 20th Century that very few people have heard of. A great fighter pilot who then went on to design the F-15 and F-16 fighter aircraft and ended his career as a military theorist whose ideas the US successfully used in both Gulf Wars. Boyd was an iconoclast who continually found himself fighting the Air Force hierarchy. As well as in-depth biography of Boyd, the book also provides an eye-opening inside view of Military-Industrial complex that Eisenhower warned of. Boyd was deeply flawed in many ways but had a personal code of honor that guided him throughout his career. My favorite quote of Boyd‚Äôs from the book is:\n\n\n‚ÄúIf your boss demands loyalty, give him integrity. But if he demands integrity, then give him loyalty‚Äù\n\n\nBorn A Crime - Stories From A South African Childhood by Trevor Noah: This had gotten rave reviews when it first came out, and they were well-deserved. Trevor Noah is a huge success today, but he‚Äôs had a remarkable and difficult early life. Along with being his personal story, this is also a story of South Africa during and after the overturning of Apartheid. Noah lets the reader see what it was like growing up poor and black in South Africa but always showing the humanity of the people he came into contact with.\nFreezing Order - A True Story Of Money Laundering, Murder, And Surviving Vladimir Putin‚Äôs Wrath by Bill Browder: A follow up to Red Notice this time continuing the story through the American court system. Lots of amazing twists and turn as Browder tussles with Russia in the courts.\nNever Split The Difference - Negotiating As If Your Life Depended On It by Chris Voss: I thought this was going to be one of those ‚Äúone-idea‚Äù books that litters the broad self-help genre, but actually it was both entertaining as well as full of very practical tips. I used some of the tips in a negotiation in 2022 to good effect :-)"

A number of good takeaways from this book - for me the primary one was to avoid binary classifications that inevitably become ‚Äúthem and us‚Äù.\nTalk Lean - Shorter Meetings. Quicker Results. Better Relations by Alan Palmer: Lot of useful tips in this book about how to use more precise language to get better results. Some of the examples feel very British but I think the advice is universal.\nLords Of Finance by Liaquat Ahamed: Fascinating account of the period after the First World War where many countries fell into recession and depression and the attempts of key central bankers to try and prevent that from happening but that often made things worse. I feel understand the role of central banks much better after reading this.\nAltitude Or Attitude - A Geeks‚Äôs Travel Log; San Francisco To Concordia-K2-Gondogoro La Of Pakistan by Ifti Mirza: This was gifted to me by the author who was a colleague at Meta (although we never met in person). The writing could do with some editing, but the story is an unexpectedly thrilling account of getting to the K2 basecamp and back. I have no particular interest in climbing and I really enjoyed this book, so if you have a passion for climbing I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll love it. It made me realize this particular trip is something I will never want to subject myself to!\nThe 6 Types Of Working Genius - A Better Way To Understand Your Gifts, Your Frustrations, And Your Team by Patrick M. Lencioni: I‚Äôm a fan of Lencioni‚Äôs books and this one provides useful insights into the sorts of things that might provide different people either joy or frustration at work. I used the model from the book with my team at Meta for our second team ‚Äúsummit‚Äù (aka offsite in the world of Finance) and found it very helpful.\nSeven Brief Lessons On Physics by Carlo Rovelli: Another slim volume from Carlos Rovelli that packs many interesting facts to ponder on, wrapped up in Rovelli‚Äôs at times poetic style of writing.\nThe Lion Tracker‚Äôs Guide To Life by Boyd Varty: Recommended by a friend who grew up in South Africa and has received personal coaching by Varty. The book provides insights into a whole world that I knew very little about but that we can learn a lot from.\nThe Psychology Of Money - Timeless Lessons On Wealth, Greed, And Happiness by Morgan Housel: This felt like a series of essays on how to live, but using money and wealth as a hook. I enjoyed it."

The premise is that there are people whose life keeps repeating starting from birth but they remember everything they experienced and learnt in previous lives. The chief protagonist, Harry August, is one such person. Well thought out and generally self-consistent - I recommend it if you like the genre.\nUnderground Airlines by Ben Winters: A book in the ‚Äúalternative history‚Äù genre, which is another genre I like.

    "text": "I Will Follow\nThere are some writers that I read pretty much anything they publish. Michael Connelly is one such author. Nick Hornby is another writer that can generally be relied upon to produce a readable novel. Blake Crouch is getting there for me as I work my way through his earlier works. - The Dark Hours by Michael Connelly - Just Like You by Nick Hornby - Good Behavior by Blake Crouch."

I think this was helped by the number of memoirs I read. Audible was far and away my input source of choice."

    "title": "What I read in 2019",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I managed to read 36 books in 2019 - slightly off my target of 40, but not bad considering extenuating circumstances. For full disclosure, the total of 36 does include 5 ‚ÄòAudible Originals‚Äô that are shorter than a typical book - and in some cases, a bit of a stretch to be called a book. On the other hand the longest book I ‚Äòread‚Äô - Cryptonomicon - was a whopping 1,139 pages / 42 hrs and 44 minutes listening time! The vast majority were audiobooks, but I have started reading physical books again rather than just e-books.\nFavorite non-fiction books that I read in 2019: The Half Has Never Been Told by Edward R. Baptist was an eye-opening account of slavery in the period between Independence and the Civil War. He shows in detail how capitalism and profit drove the slave trade, the systematic torture that produced ever increasing cotton yields and how US and European banks created financial instruments with slaves as the underlying collateral.\nEducated by Tara Westover deservedly made a lot of ‚ÄòBest of 2018‚Äô book lists. It is a gripping and at times difficult-to-read memoir of a girl growing up in a survivalist Mormon family. Difficult because many of her experiences growing up are so harrowing. How she went from being (barely) home-schooled on an Idaho mountain-side to studying in Cambridge and Harvard is worth every minute you spend reading it.\nI loved Algorithms to Live By by Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths, especially as a software developer who studied Electrical Engineering rather than Computer Science and have never really got the grounding in Algorithms that CS majors have. This is in no way a dry text book but an enjoyable tour through different categories of algorithms and how they have relevance in every day life outside of a computer program.\nThinking in Systems: A Primer by Donnella Meadows was originally published in 2008 and was a Farnam Street blog recommendation. It‚Äôs starts off with the basics of systems‚Äô modelling and feedback mechanisms. Again not a textbook, but an easy to read introduction to systems analysis and how to apply to it to real-world problems. Even though modeling feedback control systems was something I had done back in university, I still found this a valuable read.\nRebooting AI by Gary Marcus and Ernest Davis is a useful counterbalance to the current hyperbole around AI. The authors make a convincing argument that current machine learning methods, including deep learning, are not sufficient to achieve anything like true Artificial General Intelligence. What‚Äôs not so clear is what, if anything, will get us there - the authors argue for a renewed focus on understanding human cognition with a hybrid of current machine learning with symbolic inference based on knowledge-bases being the way forward.\nI approached Malcom Gladwell‚Äôs Talking To Strangers with some trepidation. He is a great storyteller and his books are always a pleasure to read, but the premise or theory underlying some of his previous books (e.g.¬†Blink or Outliers) has often turned out to be somewhat flawed. His latest book doesn‚Äôt seem to have a (to my mind at least) controversial underlying theory, so hopefully will stand the test of time better. As an aside, this book seems to be an exception to the general rule that authors shouldn‚Äôt narrate their own books and in fact makes great use of the audiobook format, using actual recordings of interviews wherever possible.\nMichael Lewis is another great storyteller, and when I finally got around to listening to The Undoing Project I wasn‚Äôt disappointed. Maybe I‚Äôll make another attempt at finishing Daniel Kahneman‚Äôs Thinking, Fast and Slow in 2020!\nFavorite fiction books that I read in 2019: In non-fiction, I really liked Recursion by Blake Crouch - I‚Äôm a sucker for anything time-travel related and this story was very well done I thought. I discovered Dervla McTiernan and her detective novels, The Ruin and The Scholar set in my hometown of Galway - she‚Äôs no Tana French, but writing is decent enough and the setting makes them compelling, at least for me. Continuing the Irish theme, A Keeper and Holding by Graham Norton were enjoyable. The premise of Redshirts by John Scalzi was very clever and enough to keep me interested through some strangely stilted language. I recommend Righteous and Wrecked by Joe Ide for fans of detective novels and, of course, Michael Connelly (The Night Fire) never fails to please\nIn it‚Äôs own category‚Ä¶ I guess that strictly speaking it‚Äôs in the fiction category, but The Unicorn Project by Gene Kim is a compelling read for anyone working in software development, especially in an enterprise environment. The follow-up to the brilliant The Phoenix Project, the Unicorn Project is actually set during the same period as the earlier book and gives the Dev side of the DevOps, whereas the Phoenix Project‚Äôs viewpoint was more the Ops side."

I communicate with close friends (my ‚Äústrong ties‚Äù) by calling or messaging them directly, but I typically don‚Äôt want to fill up my address book with contact details of people I worked with twenty years ago. Just trying to keep the details up to date would be a major effort. Instead I rely on LinkedIn to keep us connected.\nThe problem for me though was that mixed in with those strong and weak ties were a very large amount of ‚Äúno ties‚Äù - people who had asked to be added to my network but never communicated with me again. There were a lot of those, and I wanted to focus on the people in my network that I actually knew. I quickly figured out that trying to work through my network using the LinkedIn website was a waste of time. The sorting and filtering tools are rudimentary and paging through the list of connections was slow and frustrating, especially if you had to start again from the beginning if the page refreshed for some reason.\nInstead I used the facility LinkedIn provides to download your data to get a list of my contacts in CSV format. I loaded these into Excel and annotated them into Known, Unknown and Not Sure."

He was the same age as me (within a few months) and had retired early to spend time with his family in Cornwall, far from the stress of life in London. I could write many pages on what a great guy Andy was and how much he will be missed by all those whom he interacted with. Instead let me direct you to a memorial page created by his colleagues at BP.\nAt that point I lost my appetite for sending out further season‚Äôs greetings and instead decided to leverage my contact list to pass on the sad news to everyone who I knew that had also worked with Andy. We had worked together at JP Morgan, Cygnifi and Bank of America so that list was over 100 people."

Hari uncovers 12 causes for the attention crisis. A thought provoking book, though I found the more personal earlier chapters more appealing than the later ones where he talks about broader societal issues.\n‚ÄúFour Thousand Weeks - Time Management for Mortals‚Äù by Oliver Burkeman has a potentially misleading title, especially if you‚Äôre reading it to find time saving tips and tricks. It‚Äôs a much more philosophical work that starts with the premise that an average 80-year life consists of about 4,000 weeks. If, like me, you‚Äôre well past the mid-point of the average life-span, thinking about the number of weeks you have left does make you ponder how much of that time should be spent doom-scrolling on social media or binge-watching a series on Netflix.

    "text": "We Can Work It Out\nOne topic I‚Äôve been very interested in over the last few years is the idea of dialog and how personally and as a society we can discuss strongly held but opposing beliefs without it devolving into a shouting match (or silent seething). A number of books I read this year were on this or related topics. ‚ÄúThe Righteous Mind - Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion‚Äù by pyschologist Jonathan Haidt was the ‚Äòdeepest‚Äô of these books. It took me a while to read, not because the language was difficult but the concepts introduced deserved a lot of thought and digestion. Haidt covers the field of moral psychology and gives us a history of the different theories of how and why morals evolved drawing on research in neuroscience, genetics, social psychology and evolutionary modeling. As someone who leans liberal, I came away with a better understanding of why conservatives take the positions they do. Haidt has a distinctly secular view on religion and morals, which I don‚Äôt personally agree with, but his theories are worth trying to understand.\n\n\n\n‚ÄúI Never Thought Of It That Way‚Äù by Monica Guzman is a much lighter read on a similar topic. It has a lot of anecdotes from the authors life with practical suggestions about bridging the divide with people who hold an opposing view. I enjoyed the book and came away with a bunch of practical (if not ground-breaking) tools.\nI read the first version of ‚ÄúCrucial Conversations: Tools for Talking When Stakes Are High‚Äù by Kerry Patterson many years ago and for some reasons it never made much of an impression (perhaps I was not mature enough at the time to understand the lessons from the book). This time around, I found this book full of practical and useful guidelines for approaching difficult conversations.\n‚ÄúYou‚Äôre Not Listening: What You‚Äôre Missing and Why It Matters‚Äù by Kate Murphy and ‚ÄúConflicted: How Productive Disagreements Lead to Better Outcomes‚Äù by Ian Leslie were a couple of other books in this general area that I read - both were ok but essential reading."

A story of how an IRS agent managed to trace Bitcoin transactions around the globe and identify the real people behind various corners of the dark web. A great read. Pair this with ‚ÄúNumber Go Up: Inside Crypto‚Äôs Wild Rise and Staggering Fall‚Äù by Zeke Faux which goes into depth about a cryptocurrency called Tether as well diving into the rise and fall of Sam Bankman Fried and FTX. If you have ever gotten random texts from strangers (usually someone purporting to be an attractive Asian female) who try and draw you into a conversation, read the chapter on ‚ÄúPig Butchering‚Äù to understand what is actually going on.\n‚ÄúNarconomics: How to Run a Drug Cartel‚Äù by Tom Wainwright was a fascinating insight into the economics of the drug trade. I learnt that relationship between drug cartels and the drug growers is similar to that between farmers and (say) Walmart and how focusing on eradicating a drug crop does little to harm the drug cartels and just increases the costs of the growers."

The book is emotional, raw and not easy to listen to in some places. She had a difficult life and went through much more trauma than I knew about before listening to her autobiography. She never saw herself as a star and rebelled against the trappings of the music industry. RIP Sinead O‚ÄôConnor.\n\n\n\nSurrender is a much more ‚Äúproduced‚Äù affair, with music introducing each chapter and punctuating various parts of the book. Bono is definitely a polarizing figure and I‚Äôm sure some people would rather watch pain dry than listen to Bono pontificate. However, I have a soft spot for him and really enjoyed the book. There are a lot of intimate details of his early life, coping (or not) with the early death of his mother through to some of his wilder rock star moments. It‚Äôs a good example of how an audiobook can be much more than just a straighforward narration of a written book."

The chapter on Understanding Our Material World provided insights on society‚Äôs reliance what Smil calls the ‚ÄòThe Four Pillars of Modern Civilization‚Äô: Ammonia, Plastics, Steel and Concrete. The book provides a lot of data showing the difficulties of extricating ourselves from fossil fuels - a potentially depressing reality check.\n‚ÄúStuff Matters: Exploring the Marvelous Materials That Shape Our Man-Made World‚Äù by Mark Miodownik was an interesting companion read about common-place items and materials that we often take for granted: steel, paper, concrete, chocolate, foam, plastic, glass, graphite, porcelain and implants.\n‚ÄúThe Things We Make: The Unknown History of Invention from Cathedrals to Soda Cans‚Äù by Bill Hammack is a homage to engineers and the ‚Äúengineering method‚Äù.

Before reading the book, my recollection was that it was a Shia uprising, a view that still seems to be commonly held. With the American Embassy being stormed in Tehran only weeks earlier, the US government assumed the Iranians were behind this attack and briefed the press accordingly. In fact this was very much a Sunni Salafi rebellion proclaiming the arrival of the awaited Mahdi. In the days before the Internet, mobile phones and social media the Saudi government was able to maintain an information blockade about the true nature and extent of the rebellion, which was eventually subdued with the help of French commandos but only after a large death toll. You can draw direct connections from this uprising to the assasination of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and the birth of Al-Qaeda.\nIf you‚Äôve ever wondered why American towns and cities feel so different to their European counterparts, ‚ÄúConfessions of a Recovering Engineer: Transportation for a Strong Town‚Äù by Charles L. Marohn Jr.¬†is a good place to start. Standard design practices adopted by traffic engineers have given supremacy to the car over the needs of humans. Highly recommended if you are interested in urban or transportation issues.\n‚ÄúDiscipline Is Destiny: The Power of Self-Control‚Äù by Ryan Holiday was a short and easy read with bite sized chapters. Holiday provides examples from various figures from both ancient and modern history to show the benefits of self-discipline and temperance.\n‚ÄúSmart Brevity: The Power of Saying More With Less‚Äù by Jim Vandehei is best read in physical book form to get the full effect of its typography and visual design. Not super deep, but has plenty of actionable advice on how to succinctly but with impact."

There‚Äôs no real plot - once you get past waiting for something dramatic to happen and just enjoy the journey, the book is quite enjoyable.\n‚ÄúThe Reading List‚Äù by Sara Nisha Adams was a story about the important of reading and the insights good novels can provide into relationships and the human condition.\nIn ‚ÄúThe Midnight Library‚Äù by Matt Haig the library is more of a metaphor. Each book is an alternate life you might have lived. Being a fan of multiverse scenarios I enjoyed this book, although its not really a science fiction book, it just uses that conceipt as a way of showing the different paths a person could have taken and the consequences of those decisions.\nI read ‚ÄúThe Night Agent‚Äù by Matthew Quirk before watching the Netflix series based on the book. Both are enjoyable - as is typical, the plot in the book is a bit more involved than the TV series.\n‚ÄúReamde‚Äù by Neal Stephenson was the longest book I ‚Äúread‚Äù (well, listened to) this year. Although a lot of the technology it references is now a bit dated, as a whole the book still holds up well with lots of twists and turns that come to a satisfying conclusion."

    "text": "I‚Äôve only read 17 books in 2020. I started well, completing 10 books by the end of February, but then Covid happened. Working from home killed my reading velocity. The roughly 3 hours a day I spent commuting was my reading time. I would typically read non-fiction during the morning commute when my brain was sharp and able to absorb new ideas. On the way home, I would escape to fiction. I still haven‚Äôt been able to replace that commute time with at-home reading time on a regular basis. There always seems to be something slightly more pressing to do at home than sitting down and reading a book.\nIn any case, my standout book so far in 2020 has been Spillover - Animal Infections And The Next Human Pandemic by David Quammen. Essential reading for a Covid-19 world.\nThe Art of Statistics - How To Learn From Data by David Spiegelhalter was an entertaining and educational tour through the world of statistics.\nI enjoyed listening to Alchemy: The Dark Art and Curious Science of Creating Magic in Brands, Business, and Life by Rory Sutherland. The content was thought-provoking and the narration by the author was excellent."

(I can‚Äôt remember the exact article, but googling ‚Äòread 50 books a year‚Äô brings up a lot of articles and blog posts, so it‚Äôs clearly a popular concept.)\nAlthough I love physical books, I switched to e-books some years ago. I typically read during my commute (~3 hrs a day) either on my Kindle or by listening to an audiobook. Ever since Amazon bought Audible a few years back they have been improving the integration between their e-books and audiobooks, so that if you own both, your reading position gets synched between them. They often have deals where you can get the audiobooks for a few dollars when you buy the e-book, so I have been doing that whenever I get the chance.\nI fell short of the target of 50 this year, but here‚Äôs what I did get through in 2016 (click through for more details on each book):\n\nEx-Heroes - Peter Clines\nEx-Patriots - Peter Clines\nEx-Isle - Peter Clines\nEx-Communication: A Novel - Peter Clines\nEx-Purgatory: A Novel - Peter Clines\nEx-Isle: A Novel - Peter Clines\nThe Thief Lord - Cornelia Funke\nThe Joy of jQuery: A Beginner‚Äôs Guide to the World‚Äôs Most Popular Javascript Library - Alan Forbes\nThe Joy of Bootstrap: A smarter way to learn the world‚Äôs most popular web framework - Alan Forbes\nA Software Engineer Learns HTML5, JavaScript and jQuery: A guide to standards based web applications - Dane Cameron\nRadical Focus: Achieving Your Most Important Goals With Objectives and Key Results - Christina Wodtke\nGive and Take: Why Helping Others Drives Our Success - Adam Grant Ph.

Field names can be changed without impact but field tags cannot be changed without invalidating any data already written. To maintain forward compatibility, a new scheme can add a field (using a new field tag) - old code will just skip the bytes following an unrecognized field tag. For backward compatibility, a new field can be added so long as it is optional - otherwise new code reading old data will not find the new required field. When removing a field, to maintain both forward and backward compatibility, the removed field must be optional (and you can‚Äôt use the same field tag again).\nAvro handles schema evolution by storing the writer‚Äôs schema in the file. When code with a new schema reads the file, it can compare the new schema with the old schema in the file. To maintain compatibility, only fields with a default value can be added or removed."

London: Slough House is the MI5 branch where disgraced operatives are reassigned after they‚Äôve messed up too badly to be trusted with real intelligence work. The ‚ÄúSlow Horses,‚Äù as the failed spies of Slough House are called, are doomed to spend the rest of their careers pushing paper, but they all want back in on the action. When one of their own is kidnapped and held for ransom, the agents of Slough House must defeat the odds, overturning all expectations of their competence, to breach the top-notch security of MI5‚Äôs intelligence headquarters, Regent‚Äôs Park, and steal valuable intel in exchange for their comrade‚Äôs safety. The kidnapping is only the tip of the iceberg, however‚Äîthe agents uncover a larger web of intrigue that involves not only a group of private mercenaries but the highest authorities in the Secret Service. After years spent as the lowest on the totem pole, the Slow Horses suddenly find themselves caught in the midst of a conspiracy that threatens not only the future of Slough House, but of MI5 itself."

For most people, conflict triggers a fight or flight response. Disagreeing productively is a hard skill for which neither evolution or society has equipped us. It‚Äôs a skill we urgently need to acquire; otherwise, our increasingly vociferous disagreements are destined to tear us apart. Productive disagreement is a way of thinking, perhaps the best one we have. It makes us smarter and more creative, and it can even bring us closer together. It‚Äôs critical to the success of any shared enterprise, from a marriage, to a business, to a democracy. Isn‚Äôt it time we gave more thought to how to do it well? In an increasingly polarized world, our only chance for coming together and moving forward is to learn from those who have mastered the art and science of disagreement. In this book, we‚Äôll learn from experts who are highly skilled at getting the most out of highly charged encounters: interrogators, cops, divorce mediators, therapists, diplomats, psychologists. These professionals know how to get something valuable - information, insight, ideas‚Äìfrom the toughest, most antagonistic conversations. They are brilliant communicators: masters at shaping the conversation beneath the conversation. They know how to turn the heat of conflict into the light of creativity, connection, and insight. In this much-need book, Ian Leslie explores what happens to us when we argue, why disagreement makes us stressed, and why we get angry. He explains why we urgently need to transform the way we think about conflict and how having better disagreements can make us more successful. By drawing together the lessons he learns from different experts, he proposes a series of clear principles that we can all use to make our most difficult dialogues more productive‚Äìand our increasingly acrimonious world a better place."

As with the first reading I got through the first three books very quickly and enjoyed reminding myself of the plot intricacies and nuanced characterization that the tv series could not show. However, things slowed down dramatically with the fourth book, A Feast for Crows, and it was a bit of a slog to get to the end.

In this age of big data, a basic grasp of statistical literacy is more important than ever if we want to separate the fact from the fiction, the ostentatious embellishments from the raw evidence ‚Äì and even more so if we hope to participate in the future, rather than being simple bystanders. In The Art of Statistics, world- renowned statistician David Spiegelhalter shows readers how to derive knowledge from raw data by focusing on the concepts and connections behind the math. Drawing on real world examples to introduce complex issues, he shows us how statistics can help us determine the luckiest passenger on the Titanic, whether a notorious serial killer could have been caught earlier, and if screening for ovarian cancer is beneficial. The Art of Statistics not only shows us how mathematicians have used statistical science to solve these problems ‚Äì it teaches us how we too can think like statisticians. We learn how to clarify our questions, assumptions, and expectations when approaching a problem, and ‚Äì perhaps even more importantly ‚Äì we learn how to responsibly interpret the answers we receive.

Lots of Number\n\nA variety of statistics can be used to summarize the empirical distribution of data-points, including measures of location and spread.\nSkewed data distributions are common, and some summary statistics are very sensitive to outlying values.\nData summaries always hide some detail, and care is required so that important information is not lost.\nSingle sets of numbers can be visualized in strip- charts, box-and-whisker plots and histograms.\nConsider transformations to better reveal patterns, and use the eye to detect patterns, outliers, similarities and clusters.\nLook at pairs of numbers as scatter-plots, and time- series as line-graphs.\nWhen exploring data, a primary aim is to find factors that explain the overall variation.\nGraphics can be both interactive and animated.\nInfographics highlight interesting features and can guide the viewer through a story, but should be used with awareness of their purpose and their impact.\n\n\n\nWhy Are We Looking At Data Anyway? Populations and Measurement\n\nInductive inference requires working from our data, through study sample and study population, to a target population.\nProblems and biases can crop up at each stage of this path.\nThe best way to proceed from sample to study population is to have drawn a random sample.\nA population can be thought of as a group of individuals, but also as providing the probability distribution for a random observation drawn from that population.\nPopulations can be summarized using parameters that mirror the summary statistics of sample data.\nOften data does not arise as a sample from a literal population. When we have all the data there is, then we can imagine it drawn from a metaphorical population of events that could have occurred, but didn‚Äôt.\n\n\n\nWhat Causes What?\n\nCausation, in the statistical sense, means that when we intervene, the chances of different outcomes are systematically changed.\nCausation is difficult to establish statistically, but well-designed randomized trials are the best available framework.\nPrinciples of blinding, intention-to-treat and so on have enabled large-scale clinical trials to identify moderate but important effects.\nObservational data may have background factors influencing the apparent observed relationships between an exposure and an outcome, which may be either observed confounders or lurking factors.\nStatistical methods exist for adjusting for other factors, but judgement is always required as to the confidence with which causation can be claimed.\n\n\n\nModeling Relationships Using Regression\n\nRegression models provide a mathematical representation between a set of explanatory variables and a response variable.\nThe coefficients in a regression model indicate how much we expect the response to change when the explanatory variable is observed to change.\nRegression-to-the-mean occurs when more extreme responses revert to nearer the long-term average, since a contribution to their previous extremeness was pure chance.\nRegression models can incorporate different types of response variable, explanatory variables and non- linear relationships.\nCaution is required in interpreting models, which should not be taken too literally: ‚ÄôAll models are wrong, but some are useful.\n\n\n\nAlgorithms, Analytics and Prediction\n\nAlgorithms built from data can be used for classification and prediction in technological applications .\nIt is important to guard against over-fitting an algorithm to training data , essentially fitting to noise rather than signal\nAlgorithms can be evaluated by the classification accuracy , their ability to discriminate between groups , and their overall predictive accuracy\nComplex algorithms may lack transparency , and it may be worth trading off some accuracy for comprehension\nThe use of algorithms and artificial intelligence presents many challenges , and insights into both the power and limitations of machine-learning methods is vital\n\n\n\nHow Sure Can We Be About What Is Going On? Estimates and Intervals\n\nUncertainty intervals are an important part of communicating statistics.\nBootstrapping a sample consists of creating new data sets of the same size by resampling the original data, with replacement.\nSample statistics calculated from bootstrap re- samples tend towards a normal distribution for larger data sets, regardless of the shape of the original data distribution.\nUncertainty intervals based on bootstrapping take advantage of modern computer power, do not require assumptions about the mathematical form of the population and do not require complex probability theory.\n\n\n\nProbability- the Language of Uncertainty and Variability\n\nThe theory of probability provides a formal language and mathematics for dealing with chance phenomena.\nThe implications of probability are not intuitive, but insights can be improved by using the idea of expected frequencies.\nThe ideas of probability are useful even when there is no explicit use of a randomizing mechanism.\nMany social phenomena show a remarkable regularity in their overall pattern, while individual events are entirely unpredictable.\n\n\n\nPutting Probability and Statistics Together\n\nProbability theory can be used to derive the sampling distribution of summary statistics, from which formulae for confidence intervals can be derived.\nA 95% confidence interval is the result of a procedure that, in 95% of cases in which its assumptions are correct, will contain the true parameter value. It cannot be claimed that a specific interval has 95% probability of containing the true value.\nThe Central Limit Theorem implies that sample means and other summary statistics can be assumed to have a normal distribution for large samples.\nMargins of error usually do not incorporate systematic error due to non-random causes ‚Äì external knowledge and judgement is required to assess these.\nConfidence intervals can be calculated even when we observe all the data, which then represent uncertainty about the parameters of an underlying metaphorical population.\n\n\n\nAnswering Questions and Claiming Discoveries\n\nTests of null hypotheses - default assumptions about statistical models ‚Äì form a major part of statistical practice.\nA P-value is a measure of the incompatibility between the observed data and a null hypothesis: formally it is the probability of observing such an extreme result, were the null hypothesis true.\nTraditionally, P-value thresholds of 0.05 and 0.01 have been set to declare ‚Äòstatistical significance‚Äô.\nThese thresholds need to be adjusted if multiple tests are conducted, for example on different subsets of the data or multiple outcome measures.\nThere is a precise correspondence between confidence intervals and P-values: if, say, the 95% interval excludes 0, we can reject the null hypothesis of 0 at P &lt; 0.05.\nNeyman-Pearson theory specifies an alternative hypothesis, and fixes Type I and Type II error rates for the two possible kinds of errors in a hypothesis test.\nSeparate forms of hypothesis tests have been developed for sequential testing.\nP-values are often misinterpreted: in particular they do not convey the probability that the null hypothesis is true, nor does a non-significant result imply that the null hypothesis is true.\n\n\n\nLearning from Experience the Bayesian Way\n\nBayesian methods combine evidence from data (summarized by the likelihood) with initial beliefs (known as the prior distribution) to produce a posterior probability distribution for the unknown quantity.\nBayes‚Äô theorem for two competing hypotheses can be expressed as posterior odds = likelihood ratio x prior odds.\nThe likelihood ratio expresses the relative support for two hypotheses from an item of evidence, and is sometimes used to summarize forensic evidence in criminal trials.\nWhen the prior distribution comes from some physical sampling process, Bayesian methods are uncontroversial. However generally a degree of judgement is necessary.\nHierarchical models allow evidence to be pooled across multiple small analyses that are assumed to have parameters in common.\nBayes factors are the equivalent of likelihood ratios for scientific hypotheses, and are a controversial substitute for null-hypothesis significance testing.\nThe theory of statistical inference has a long history of controversy, but issues of quality of data and scientific reliability are more important.\n\n\n\nHow Things Go Wrong\n\nPoor statistical practice has some responsibility for the crisis in the reproducibility of science.\nDeliberate fabrication of data appears to be fairly rare, but errors in statistical methods are frequent.\nAn even greater problem is questionable research practices that tend to lead to exaggerated claims of statistical significance.\nIn the pipeline by which statistical evidence reaches the public, press offices, journalists and editors add to the flow of unjustified statistical claims through their use of questionable interpretation and communication practices.\n\n\nHow We Can Do Statistics Better\n\nProducers, communicators and audiences all have a role in improving the way that statistical science is used in society.\nProducers need to ensure that science is reproducible. To demonstrate trustworthiness, information should be accessible, intelligible, assessable and useable.\nCommunicators need to be wary of trying to fit statistical stories into standard narratives.\nAudiences need to call out poor practice by asking questions about the trustworthiness of their numbers, their source and their interpretation.\nWhen faced with a claim based on statistical evidence, first feel whether it seems plausible.\n\n\n\n\nRules for Effective Statistical Practice\n\nStatistical methods should enable data to answer scientific questions: Ask ‚Äòwhy am I doing this?‚Äô, rather than focusing on which particular technique to use.\nSignals always come with noise: It is trying to separate out the two that makes the subject interesting. Variability is inevitable, and probability models are useful as an abstraction.\nPlan ahead, really ahead: This includes the idea of pre- specification in confirmatory experiments - avoiding researcher degrees of freedom.\nWorry about data quality: Everything rests on the data.\nStatistical analysis is more than a set of computations: Do not just plug into formulae or run procedures in software, without knowing why you are doing so.\nKeep it simple: The main communication should be as basic as possible - do not show off skills in complex modelling unless they are really necessary.\nProvide assessments of variability: With the warning that margins of error are generally bigger than claimed.\nCheck your assumptions: And make clear when this has not been possible.\nWhen possible, replicate!: Or encourage others to do so.\nMake your analysis reproducible: Others should be able to access your data and code."

In fact, I specifically chose that particular routing so that I would drive by Einstein‚Äôs house.\nThe premise of this book is that after World War II Albert Einstein would invite philosopher and (sometime) pacifist, Bertrand Russell, quantum physicist, Wolfgang Pauli and the brilliant logician, Kurt G√∂del to his house to discuss science and philosophy. I bought the book under the impression that it would uncover the secrets of what these great men discussed but the reality is that there‚Äôs is very little known about these meetings, if indeed the four were ever actually there at the same time. The only written record of these meetings comes from a passing remark in Russell‚Äôs Autobiography. G√∂del claims to have only ever had one discussion with Russell.\nStill it‚Äôs a useful hook from which to hang biographies of each man as well as many of their contemporaries (especially Heisenberg and Oppenheimer) and the scientific milieu that each was a part of.

    "text": "Numbers Don‚Äôt Lie by Vaclav Smil\n\n\nisbn-13: 9780143136224\nPaperback\nThis was a book chosen by another of the multiple book clubs I‚Äôm part of at Meta (n√©e Facebook). I‚Äôm glad because it was a truly enlightening read. Vaclav Smil uses the numbers and data to reveal a deeper understanding of the state of our world.\nThere are 71 stories grouped into the following categories: - People: The Inhabitants of Our World - Countries: Nations in the Age of Globalization - Machines, Designs, Devices: Inventions That Made Our Modern World. - Fuels and Electricity: Energizing Our Societies - Transport: How We Get Around - Food: Energizing Ourselves\nThere are really no boring stories. Here are some excerpts from a few that were particularly memorable:\n\nHow sweating improved hunting\n\nIt all comes down to sweating. The two large animals we have mainly used for transport perspire profusely compared to other quadrupeds: in one hour, a horse can lose about 100 grams of water per square meter of skin, and a camel can lose up to 250 g/m¬≤. However, a human being can easily shed 500 g/m¬≤, enough to remove between 550 and 600 watts‚Äô worth of heat. Peak hourly sweating rates can surpass 2 kilograms per square meter, and the highest reported short-term sweating rate is twice that high.\nWe are the superstars of sweating, and we need to be. An amateur running the marathon at a slow pace will consume energy at a rate of 700-800 watts, and an experienced marathoner who covers the 42.2 kilometers in 2.5 hours will metabolize at a rate of about 1,300 watts.\n\n\n\nHow many people did it take to build the Great Pyramid?\n\nPeople are able to convert about 20 percent of food into useful work, and for hard-working men that energy amounts to about 440 kilojoules a day.\n\n\n\nBrexit: Realities that matter most will not change\n\nThe country‚Äôs old-age dependency ratio (number of people 65 and older as a share of all economically active people 20-64 years of age), standing at 32 percent in 2020 ‚Äì still slightly lower than in France or Germany - will increase to 47% by the year 2050. No government intervention and no declaration of regained sovereignty and severance from the bureaucrats of Brussels will have any effect on this inexorable process.\n\n\nGiven these fundamental realities, a rational observer must wonder what tangible differences, what clear benefits could any reassertion of British insularity bring. False claims can be painted on buses, extravagant promises are easy to make, feelings of pride or satisfaction may become fleetingly convincing - but none of those intangibles can change what the UK has become: an aging nation; a deindustrialized and worn-out country whose per capita GDP is now just over half of the Irish mean (something that Swift, Gladstone, or Churchill would find utterly unfathomable); another has-been power whose claim to uniqueness rests on having too many troubled princes and on exporting costumed TV series set in fading country mansions staffed with too many servants.\n\n\n\nConcerns about Japan‚Äôs future\n\nIn the long run, the fortunes of nations are determined by population trends. Japan is not only the world‚Äôs fastest-aging major economy (already every fourth person is older than 65, and by 2050 that share will be nearly 40 percent), its population is also declining. Today‚Äôs 127 million will shrink to 97 million by 2050, and forecasts show shortages of the young labor force needed in construction and healthcare. Who will maintain Japan‚Äôs extensive and admirably efficient transportation infrastructures? Who will take care of the millions of old people? By 2050, people above the age of 8o will outnumber the children.\n\nPublisher‚Äôs Description: ‚ÄúVaclav Smil is my favorite author‚Ä¶ Numbers Don‚Äôt Lie takes everything that makes his writing great and boils it down into an easy-to-read format. I unabashedly recommend this book to anyone who loves learning.‚Äù‚ÄìBill Gates, GatesNotes An essential guide to understanding how numbers reveal the true state of our world‚Äìexploring a wide range of topics including energy, the environment, technology, transportation, and food production. Vaclav Smil‚Äôs mission is to make facts matter. An environmental scientist, policy analyst, and a hugely prolific author, he is Bill Gates‚Äô go-to guy for making sense of our world. In Numbers Don‚Äôt Lie, Smil answers questions such as: What‚Äôs worse for the environment‚Äìyour car or your phone? How much do the world‚Äôs cows weigh (and what does it matter)? And what makes people happy? From data about our societies and populations, through measures of the fuels and foods that energize them, to the impact of transportation and inventions of our modern world‚Äìand how all of this affects the planet itself‚Äìin Numbers Don‚Äôt Lie, Vaclav Smil takes us on a fact-finding adventure, using surprising statistics and illuminating graphs to challenge conventional thinking. Packed with fascinating information and memorable examples, Numbers Don‚Äôt Lie reveals how the US is leading a rising worldwide trend in chicken consumption, that vaccination yields the best return on investment, and why electric cars aren‚Äôt as great as we think (yet). Urgent and essential, with a mix of science, history, and wit‚Äìall in bite-sized chapters on a broad range of topics‚ÄìNumbers Don‚Äôt Lie inspires readers to interrogate what they take to be true.‚Äù"

    "text": "It‚Äôs Your Ship: Management Techniques from the Best Damn Ship in the Navy by Michael Abrashoff These are two books that try and provide leadership and management guidance based on the experiences of the authors in the U.S. Navy - Marquet as commander of a nuclear powered submarine, the USS Santa Fe, Abrashoff as commander of a guided missile destroyer, the USS Benfold. I had read It‚Äôs Your Ship some years earlier, and re-read it after reading Turn the Ship Around. Both books provide the same general message - that of empowering your team to make decisions and take the initiative. Both contained entertaining stories about the ups and downs - pun intended! - of naval life. Although I enjoyed reading both, I think Turn the Ship Around has more useful takeaways.\nMarquet‚Äôs book details his transformation from the traditional ‚ÄòLeader-Follower‚Äô model typically seen in the navy as well as in business, where the leader gives the orders and his or her followers carry them out, to a ‚ÄòLeader-Leader‚Äô model where followers are empowered to make decisions about how to carry out the leader‚Äôs intent. This manifested itself in the crew of the USS Santa Fe moving from asking permission from a superior to carry out an action (‚ÄúPermission to ‚Ä¶., Sir?‚Äù - ‚ÄúPermission granted‚Äù) to one of declaring intent (‚ÄúI intend to ‚Ä¶, Sir‚Äù - ‚ÄúVery well‚Äù). The difference being that the former transfers responsibility to the leader who is giving the order, whereas the latter shifts ownership of the action to the person carrying it out."

He enters the forest, spellbound by the beauty of the Canadian wilderness, and suddenly hears the notes of a violin echoing in an airship terminal‚Äîan experience that shocks him to his core. Two centuries later a famous writer named Olive Llewellyn is on a book tour. She‚Äôs traveling all over Earth, but her home is the second moon colony, a place of white stone, spired towers, and artificial beauty. Within the text of Olive‚Äôs best-selling pandemic novel lies a strange passage: a man plays his violin for change in the echoing corridor of an airship terminal as the trees of a forest rise around him. When Gaspery-Jacques Roberts, a detective in the black-skied Night City, is hired to investigate an anomaly in the North American wilderness, he uncovers a series of lives upended: The exiled son of an earl driven to madness, a writer trapped far from home as a pandemic ravages Earth, and a childhood friend from the Night City who, like Gaspery himself, has glimpsed the chance to do something extraordinary that will disrupt the timeline of the universe. A virtuoso performance that is as human and tender as it is intellectually playful, Sea of Tranquility is a novel of time travel and metaphysics that precisely captures the reality of our current moment.‚Äù"

We have never had so much information at our fingertips and yet most of us don‚Äôt know how the world really works. This book explains seven of the most fundamental realities governing our survival and prosperity. From energy and food production, through our material world and its globalization, to risks, our environment and its future, How the World Really Works offers a much-needed reality check‚Äîbecause before we can tackle problems effectively, we must understand the facts. In this ambitious and thought- provoking book we see, for example, that globalization isn‚Äôt inevitable‚Äîthe foolishness of allowing 70 per cent of the world‚Äôs rubber gloves to be made in just one factory became glaringly obvious in 2020‚Äîand that our societies have been steadily increasing their dependence on fossil fuels, such that any promises of decarbonization by 2050 are a fairy tale. For example, each greenhouse-grown supermarket-bought tomato has the equivalent of five tablespoons of diesel embedded in its production, and we have no way of producing steel, cement or plastics at required scales without huge carbon emissions. Ultimately, Smil answers the most profound question of our age: are we irrevocably doomed or is a brighter utopia ahead? Compelling, data- rich and revisionist, this wonderfully broad, interdisciplinary guide finds faults with both extremes. Looking at the world through this quantitative lens reveals hidden truths that change the way we see our past, present and uncertain future."

Despite the hype surrounding AI, creating an intelligence that rivals or exceeds human levels is far more complicated than we have been led to believe. Professors Gary Marcus and Ernest Davis have spent their careers at the forefront of AI research and have witnessed some of the greatest milestones in the field, but they argue that a computer beating a human in Jeopardy! does not signal that we are on the doorstep of fully autonomous cars or superintelligent machines. The achievements in the field thus far have occurred in closed systems with fixed sets of rules, and these approaches are too narrow to achieve genuine intelligence. The real world, in contrast, is wildly complex and open- ended. How can we bridge this gap? What will the consequences be when we do? Taking inspiration from the human mind, Marcus and Davis explain what we need to advance AI to the next level, and suggest that if we are wise along the way, we won‚Äôt need to worry about a future of machine overlords. If we focus on endowing machines with common sense and deep understanding, rather than simply focusing on statistical analysis and gathering ever larger collections of data, we will be able to create an AI we can trust‚Äì in our homes, our cars, and our doctors‚Äô offices. Rebooting AI provides a lucid, clear-eyed assessment of the current science and offers an inspiring vision of how a new generation of AI can make our lives better.‚Äù"

    "text": "The Storm Before The Storm by Michael Duncan\n\n\nisbn-13: 9781610397216\nAudible\nFascinating backstory to the more familiar events surrounding the rise of Julius Caesar and the end of the Republic. After listening to this audiobook it becomes clear that the ‚Äòpurity‚Äô of the Roman Republic was always somewhat precarious.\nThis book introduces characters such as Gaius Marius who was consul an unprecedented seven times and hailed as ‚Äúthe third founder of Rome‚Äù, and his nemesis Sulla. We learn of the optimates, supporters of the continued authority of the senate, and populares, those who favoured the cause of the plebeians (the commoners) along with the struggles between the patricians and those considered novus homo (new man).\nThe main downside of the audiobook version is the difficulty in distinguishing between all the different Gaius and Lucius and Quintus characters.\nPublisher‚Äôs Description: ‚ÄúThe Roman Republic was one of the most remarkable achievements in the history of civilization. After its founding in 509 BCE, Rome grew from an unremarkable Italian city-state to the dominant superpower of the Mediterranean world. Through it all, the Romans never allowed a single man to seize control of the state. Every year for four hundred years the annually elected consuls voluntarily handed power to their successors. Not once did a consul give in to the temptation to grab absolute power and refuse to let it go. It was a run of political self-denial unmatched in the history of the world. The disciplined Roman republicans then proceeded to explode out of Italy and conquer a world filled with petty tyrants, barbarian chieftains, and despotic kings. But the very success of the Republic proved to be its undoing. The republican system was unable to cope with the vast empire Rome ruled. Bankrolled by mountains of imperial wealth and without a foreign enemy to keep them united, ambitious Roman leaders began to stray from the republican austerity of their ancestors. Almost as soon as they had conquered the Mediterranean, Rome would become engulfed in violent political conflicts and civil wars that would destroy the Republic less than a century later. The Storm Before the Storm tells the story of the beginning of the end of the Roman Republic‚Äìthe story of the first generation that had to cope with the dangerous new political environment made possible by Rome‚Äôs unrivaled domination over the known world. The tumultuous years from 133-80 BCE set the stage for the fall of the Republic. The Republic faced issues like rising economic inequality, increasing political polarization, the privatization of the military, endemic social and ethnic prejudice, rampant corruption, ongoing military quagmires, and the ruthless ambition and unwillingness of elites to do anything to reform the system in time to save it‚Äìa situation that draws many parallels to present-day America. These issues are among the reasons why the Roman Republic would fall. And as we all know, those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it.‚Äù"

Best known for his formulation of the OODA Loop as a model for competitive decision making, Colonel Boyd was also an original thinker in developing tactics for air-to-air combat, designing warplanes, and the fluid, mobile warfare known to the Germans as blitzkrieg and to modern armies as‚Äùmaneuver warfare.‚Äù As much as anyone, John Boyd was the architect of the two great campaigns against Saddam Hussein‚Äôs Iraq, both the 1991 liberation of Kuwait and the 2003 ‚ÄúMarch Up‚Äù to Baghdad by the U.S. Army and Marines. But what of the costly, drawn-out insurgency that baffled the invaders once Baghdad had fallen? In this short book, Daniel Ford applies Boyd‚Äôs thinking to the problem of counter-insurgency. Unlike the U.S. military in 2003, it turns out that Boyd had indeed put considerable thought into what might transpire after an effective ‚Äúblitz‚Äù campaign. Indeed, he found many similarities between ‚Äúblitzers‚Äù and what he preferred to call guerrillas, and he thought that they might be defeated by turning their own tactics against them. This is an expanded version of a dissertation submitted in the War Studies program at King‚Äôs College London.‚Äù"

Meadows‚Äô newly released manuscript, Thinking in Systems, is a concise and crucial book offering insight for problem solving on scales ranging from the personal to the global. Edited by the Sustainability Institute‚Äôs Diana Wright, this essential primer brings systems thinking out of the realm of computers and equations and into the tangible world, showing readers how to develop the systems-thinking skills that thought leaders across the globe consider critical for 21st-century life. Some of the biggest problems facing the world‚Äîwar, hunger, poverty, and environmental degradation‚Äîare essentially system failures. They cannot be solved by fixing one piece in isolation from the others, because even seemingly minor details have enormous power to undermine the best efforts of too-narrow thinking. While readers will learn the conceptual tools and methods of systems thinking, the heart of the book is grander than methodology. Donella Meadows was known as much for nurturing positive outcomes as she was for delving into the science behind global dilemmas. She reminds readers to pay attention to what is important, not just what is quantifiable, to stay humble, and to stay a learner. In a world growing ever more complicated, crowded, and interdependent, Thinking in Systems helps readers avoid confusion and helplessness, the first step toward finding proactive and effective solutions.‚Äù"

What is money anyway, and where and why did it originate? According to Jacob Goldstein, this made-up thing has evolved over centuries and takes different forms based on technological advances, the needs of society, and often the crazy ideas of outliers on the fringes. Told through witty, historical anecdotes, Goldstein demystifies this ever-evolving tool from the invention of the first coins in Mesopotamia, to how China invented paper money centuries before it appeared in the west, how at one point in Sweden men carried giant ‚Äúcoins‚Äù on their backs to pay for goods, to the gold standard, pound sterling, origins of the Euro, mutual funds, bitcoin and a cashless society. Money presents entertaining tales of fascinating characters who fundamentally changed our monetary systems such as Genghis Khan, John Law, a convicted murderer and professional gambler, the Luddites, and the anarchist cyberpunks who created bitcoin. Through these major movements we see the rise and fall of various financial institutions: central banks, the stock market, the Federal Reserve, and the shadow institutions like Lehman Brothers that helped create the financial crisis of 2008. Lively and accessible and full of interesting tidbits (the word ‚Äúbanker‚Äù comes from the Venetian ‚Äúbench sitters‚Äù-or ‚Äúbanchieri‚Äù-of the 1600s who guarded the gold) Goldstein looks at the evolution of money (whose definition appears to be, if we all agree it‚Äôs money, then it is money) and confronts its true purpose and who it is supposed to be for.‚Äù"

Graff, New York Times bestselling author of The Only Plane in the Sky and Watergate Over the last decade, a single innovation has massively fueled digital black markets: cryptocurrency. Crime lords inhabiting lawless corners of the internet have operated more freely‚Äîwhether in drug dealing, money laundering, or human trafficking‚Äîthan their analog counterparts could have ever dreamed of. By transacting not in dollars or pounds but in currencies with anonymous ledgers, overseen by no government, beholden to no bankers, these black marketeers have sought to rob law enforcement of their chief method of cracking down on illicit finance: following the money. But what if the centerpiece of this dark economy held a secret, fatal flaw? What if their currency wasn‚Äôt so cryptic after all? An investigator using the right mixture of technical wizardry, financial forensics, and old-fashioned persistence could uncover an entire world of wrongdoing. Tracers in the Dark is a story of crime and pursuit unlike any other. With unprecedented access to the major players in federal law enforcement and private industry, veteran cybersecurity reporter Andy Greenberg tells an astonishing saga of criminal empires built and destroyed. He introduces an IRS agent with a defiant streak, a Bitcoin- tracing Danish entrepreneur, and a colorful ensemble of hardboiled agents and prosecutors as they delve deep into the crypto-underworld. The result is a thrilling, globe-spanning story of dirty cops, drug bazaars, trafficking rings, and the biggest takedown of an online narcotics market in the history of the Internet. Utterly of our time, Tracers in the Dark is a cat-and-mouse story and a tale of a technological one-upmanship. Filled with canny maneuvering and shocking twists, it answers a provocative question: How would some of the world‚Äôs most brazen criminals behave if they were sure they could never get caught?"

    "section": "Part I. Individual Rethinking",
    "text": "Part I. Individual Rethinking\nHere Grant introduces the analogy of the ‚ÄòPreacher, Prosecutor, Politician and Scientist‚Äô mindsets. Not surprisingly, he advocates the Scientist mindset as the way to change your beliefs as new evidence is uncovered.\n\nAs we th√¨nk and talk, we often slip into the mindsets of three different professions: preachers, prosecutors, and politicians, In each of these modes, we take on a particular identity and use a distinct set of tools. We go into preacher mode when our sacred beliefs are in jeopardy: we deliver sermons to protect and promote our ideals. We enter prosecutor mode when we recognize flaws in other people‚Äôs reasoning: we marshal arguments to prove them wrong and win our case. We shift into politician mode when we‚Äôre seeking to win over an audience: we campaign and lobby for the approvall of our constituents. The risk is that we become so wrapped up im preaching that we‚Äôre right, prosecuting others who are wrong, and politicking for support that we don‚Äôt bother to rethink our own views.\n\n\nBut being a scientist is not just a profession. It‚Äôs a frame of mind - a mode of thinking that differs from preaching, prosecuting, and politicking. We move into scientist mode when we‚Äôre searching for the truth: we run experiments to test hypotheses and discover knowledge. Scientific tools aren‚Äôt reserved for people with white coats and beakers, and using them doesn‚Äôt require toiling away for years with a microscope and a petri dish. Hypotheses have as much of a place in our lives as they do in the lab. Experiments can inform our daily decisions.\n\nHe also explores confidence, humility, impostor syndrome and finding joy in being wrong.\n\n‚Ä¶feeling like an impostor can make us better learners. Having some doubts about our knowledge and skills takes us off a pedestal, encouraging us to seek out insights from others. As psychologist Elizabeth Krumrei Mancuso and her colleagues write, ‚ÄúLearning requires the humility to realize one has something to learn.‚Äù"

    "section": "Part II. Interpersonal Rethinking",
    "text": "Part II. Interpersonal Rethinking\nThe big takeaway for me in this part was the chapter on Motivational Interviewing.\n\nWhen we‚Äôre trying to persuade people, we frequently take an adversarial approach. Instead of opening their minds, we effectively shut them down or rile them up. They play defense by putting up a shield, play offense by preaching their perspectives and prosecuting ours, or play politics by telling us what we want to hear without changing what they actually think.\n\n\nMotivational interviewing starts with an attitude of humility and curiosity. We don‚Äôt know what might motivate someone else to change, but we‚Äôre genuinely eager to find out. The goal isn‚Äôt to tell people what to do; it‚Äôs to help them break out of overconfidence cycles and see new possibilities. Our role is to hold up a mirror so they can see themselves more clearly, and then empower them to examine their beliefs and behaviors. That can activate a rethinking cycle, in which people approach their own views more scientifically. They develop more humility about their knowledge, doubt in their convictions, and curiosity about alternative points of view.\n\n\nThe process of motivational interviewing involves three key techniques: - Asking open-ended questions - Engaging in reflective listening - Affirming the person‚Äôs desire and ability to change\n\n\nWhen people ignore advice, it isn‚Äôt always because they disagree with it. Sometimes they‚Äôre resisting the sense of pressure and the feeling that someone else is controlling their decision.\n\n\nPsychologists have found that when people detect an attempt at influence, they have sophisticated defense mechanisms. The moment people feel that we‚Äôre trying to persuade them, our behavior takes on a different meaning. A straightforward question is seen as a political tactic, a reflective listening statement comes across as a prosecutor‚Äôs maneuvering, an affirmation of their ability to change sounds like a preacher‚Äôs proselytizing."

This is the right book for right now. Yes, learning requires focus. But, unlearning and relearning requires much more‚Äîit requires choosing courage over comfort. In Think Again, Adam Grant weaves together research and storytelling to help us build the intellectual and emotional muscle we need to stay curious enough about the world to actually change it. I‚Äôve never felt so hopeful about what I don‚Äôt know.‚Äù ‚ÄîBren√© Brown, Ph.D., #1 New York Times bestselling author of Dare to Lead The bestselling author of Give and Take and Originals examines the critical art of rethinking: learning to question your opinions and open other people‚Äôs minds, which can position you for excellence at work and wisdom in life Intelligence is usually seen as the ability to think and learn, but in a rapidly changing world, there‚Äôs another set of cognitive skills that might matter more: the ability to rethink and unlearn. In our daily lives, too many of us favor the comfort of conviction over the discomfort of doubt. We listen to opinions that make us feel good, instead of ideas that make us think hard. We see disagreement as a threat to our egos, rather than an opportunity to learn. We surround ourselves with people who agree with our conclusions, when we should be gravitating toward those who challenge our thought process. The result is that our beliefs get brittle long before our bones. We think too much like preachers defending our sacred beliefs, prosecutors proving the other side wrong, and politicians campaigning for approval‚Äìand too little like scientists searching for truth. Intelligence is no cure, and it can even be a curse: being good at thinking can make us worse at rethinking. The brighter we are, the blinder to our own limitations we can become. Organizational psychologist Adam Grant is an expert on opening other people‚Äôs minds‚Äìand our own. As Wharton‚Äôs top-rated professor and the bestselling author of Originals and Give and Take, he makes it one of his guiding principles to argue like he‚Äôs right but listen like he‚Äôs wrong. With bold ideas and rigorous evidence, he investigates how we can embrace the joy of being wrong, bring nuance to charged conversations, and build schools, workplaces, and communities of lifelong learners. You‚Äôll learn how an international debate champion wins arguments, a Black musician persuades white supremacists to abandon hate, a vaccine whisperer convinces concerned parents to immunize their children, and Adam has coaxed Yankees fans to root for the Red Sox. Think Again reveals that we don‚Äôt have to believe everything we think or internalize everything we feel. It‚Äôs an invitation to let go of views that are no longer serving us well and prize mental flexibility over foolish consistency. If knowledge is power, knowing what we don‚Äôt know is wisdom.‚Äù"

The difference is that nobody ended up profiting from it. Although much blame is rightfully placed on the Trump administration‚Äôs lack of interest in public health - they dismantled the pandemic response unit that the George W. Bush administration had created and that the Obama administration maintained - above all, this book is a sweeping indictment of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and their inaction throughout the crisis.\nThe book points to systemic issues with the way public health is administered in the US and a sort of institutionalized cowardice at the heart of those systems.\nLots of potential heroes do surface in Lewis‚Äô telling of our Pandemic story but a lot of the time they are just not listened to.\nHighly recommended.\nPublisher‚Äôs Description: ‚ÄúFor those who could read between the lines, the censored news out of China was terrifying. But the president insisted there was nothing to worry about.‚Äù"

The Downing Street superforecaster‚Äîa specialist who advises the Prime Minister‚Äôs office on how policy is likely to be received by the electorate‚Äîhas disappeared without a trace. Claude Whelan, who was once head of MI5, has been tasked with tracking her down.\nBut the trail leads him straight back to Regent‚Äôs Park itself, with First Desk Diana Taverner as chief suspect. Has Taverner overplayed her hand at last? Meanwhile, her Russian counterpart, Moscow intelligence‚Äôs First Desk, has cheekily showed up in London and shaken off his escort. Are the two unfortunate events connected?\nOver at Slough House, where Jackson Lamb presides over some of MI5‚Äôs most embittered demoted agents, the slow horses are doing what they do best, and adding a little bit of chaos to an already unstable situation . . .\nThere are bad actors everywhere, and they usually get their comeuppance before the credits roll. But politics is a dirty business, and in a world where lying, cheating and backstabbing are the norm, sometimes the good guys can find themselves outgunned."

I‚Äôm not particularly a crime-fiction addict but have gotten addicted to Connelly‚Äôs writing and his characters and the LA setting for his stories. The main character, Harry Bosch, is (over the series of books) so richly drawn that he almost feels real to me. Amazon created the Bosch tv series a few years back, and its pretty good, but doesn‚Äôt compare to the Bosch that I‚Äôve built in my head over the years from reading the books.\nIn the overall body of work, The Wrong Side of Goodbye doesn‚Äôt particularly stand out.

Fascinating story, told in Mezrich‚Äôs typical breathless style. They‚Äôre all a bunch of unsavory characters though so this book fails to land any emotional impact other than a feeling of distaste.\nisbn-13: 9781476771892\nAudible\nPublisher‚Äôs Description: ‚ÄúThe bestselling author of Bringing Down the House (sixty-three weeks on the New York Times bestseller list and the basis for the hit movie 21) and The Accidental Billionaires (the basis for the Academy Award‚Äìwinning film The Social Network) delivers an epic drama of wealth, rivalry, and betrayal among mega-wealthy Russian oligarchs‚Äîand its international repercussions. Once Upon a Time in Russia is the untold true story of the larger-than-life billionaire oligarchs who surfed the waves of privatization to reap riches after the fall of the Soviet regime: ‚ÄúGodfather of the Kremlin‚Äù Boris Berezovsky, a former mathematician whose first entrepreneurial venture was running an automobile reselling business, and Roman Abramovich, his dashing young prot√©g√© who built a multi-billion-dollar empire of oil and aluminum. Locked in a complex, uniquely Russian partnership, Berezovsky and Abramovich battled their way through the ‚ÄúWild East‚Äù of Russia with Berezovsky acting as the younger man‚Äôs krysha‚Äîliterally, his roof, his protector. Written with the heart-stopping pacing of a thriller‚Äîbut even more compelling because it is true‚Äîthis story of amassing obscene wealth and power depicts a rarefied world seldom seen up close. Under Berezovsky‚Äôs krysha, Abramovich built one of Russia‚Äôs largest oil companies from the ground up and in exchange made cash deliveries‚Äîincluding 491 million dollars in just one year. But their relationship frayed when Berezovsky attacked President Vladimir Putin in the media‚Äîand had to flee to the UK. Abramovich continued to prosper. Dead bodies trailed Berezovsky‚Äôs footsteps, and threats followed him to London, where an associate of his died painfully and famously of Polonium poisoning. Then Berezovsky himself was later found dead, declared a suicide. Exclusively sourced, capturing a momentous period in recent world history, Once Upon a Time in Russia is at once personal and political, offering an unprecedented look into the wealth, corruption, and power behind what Graydon Carter called ‚Äúthe story of our age.‚Äù‚Äù"

    "text": "Do No Harm: Stories of Life, Death, and Brain Surgery by Henry Marsh\nWhen Breath Becomes Air by Paul Kalanithi\nBeing Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End by Atul Gowande\n\nI read these three books all on a medical theme in a row. They were three of the best books I read all year - all highly recommended. (I actually listened to the audiobook version of all three - I can recommend the audio versions of Do No Harm and Being Mortal, but found the narrator of When Breath Becomes Air to be insufferable - I suggest you stick to the print or ebook version of that book.) They each provide a different viewpoint on life and death, without being overly morose or heavy. Do No Harm is a series of vignettes by retired British neurosurgeon, Dr Henry Marsh. It is a truly compelling read with insights into life, death, medicine, success, failure and much more besides. The author is refreshingly honest about his failures as a surgeon in addition to the soaring successes. I didnt think I‚Äôd like it as much as I did. One to go back to again. When Breath Becomes Air ended up on many best-of-2016 lists, and deservedly so. The book is a memoir of a by-all-accounts brilliant young neurosurgeon, nearing the end of his training, who is diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. The author is..was.. a gifted writer as well as a talented surgeon, and it shows in this book. He started writing the book after the diagnosis and died before he could fully complete it. It‚Äôs a book that forces to think deeply about life, death and everything in between. The title comes from Caelica 83, a poem by Baron Brooke Fulke Greville:\n\nYou that seek what life is in death, Now find it air that once was breath. New names unknown, old names gone: Till time end bodies, but souls none. Reader! then make time, while you be, But steps to your eternity.\n\nBeing Mortal is an exploration of aging and death, and our society‚Äôs approach to end-of-life care. I really enjoyed Gowande‚Äôs book The Checklist Manifesto and his occasional articles in The New Yorker and thought this book was thought-provoking, moving and eloquent. A must-read, especially for those of us with aging parents, or indeed anyone who hopes to live to an old age."

The 6 Types of Working Genius is the fastest way to help people identify the type of work that brings them joy and energy, and avoid work that leads to frustration and burnout. Beyond the personal discovery and instant relief that Working Genius provides, the model also gives teams a remarkably simple and practical framework for tapping into one another‚Äôs natural gifts, which increases productivity and reduces unnecessary judgment. In classic Lencioni fashion, Pat brings his model to life in a page-turning fable that is as relatable as it is compelling. He tells the story of Bull Brooks, an entrepreneur, husband, and father who sets out to solve his own frustration at work and stumbles into a new way of thinking that changes the way he sees his work, his team, and even his marriage. What sets this book‚Äîand the model behind it‚Äîapart from other tools and assessments is the speed at which it can be understood and applied, and the relevance it has to every kind of work in life, from running a company to launching a product to managing a family. In addition to this book, Lencioni and the Table Group have created a 10-minute assessment that helps individuals quickly identify their gifts and apply this model to themselves and their teams.

When Rory Sutherland was a trainee working on a direct mail campaign at the famed advertising firm OgilvyOne, he noticed that very small changes in design often had immense effects on the number of consumer responses. Yet no one he worked with knew why. Sutherland began taking stock of each effective yet nebulous trick‚Äî‚Äùthe thing which has no name‚Äù‚Äîhe discovered. As he rose in the advertising industry, he began to understand why these things had no name: no one was interested in quantifying them, cataloguing them, or really investigating them. So, he did it himself. Like classic behavioral economists Daniel Kahneman and Richard Thaler, Sutherland peels away hidden, often irrational human behaviors that explain how the world around us functions. In How to Be an Alchemist he examines why certain ads work and the broader truths they tell us about who we are. Why do people prefer stripy toothpaste, and how might that help us design retirement plans that young people would actually buy? Why do we think orange juice is healthy, and how does the same principle guide our feelings about nuclear reactors? Why do budget airlines advertise services they don‚Äôt offer‚Äîand what might insurance companies learn from them about keeping healthcare costs low? Filled with startling and profound conclusions, Sutherland‚Äôs journey through the world of advertising and its surprising lessons for human behavior is insightful, brilliant, eye-opening, and irresistibly fun.‚Äù"

Although I was generally familiar with the term ‚Äòcognitive dissonance‚Äô I had not been exposed to cognitive dissonance theory in any detail. Having read this book, the world we live in today and, in particular, the fact that so many people hold beliefs that seem completely contradictory to clear facts, is much more understandable. - Cognitive dissonance is a state of tension that occurs whenever a person holds two cognitions (ideas, attitudes, beliefs, opinions) that are psychologically inconsistent, such as ‚ÄúSmoking is a dumb thing to do because it could kill me‚Äù and ‚ÄúI smoke two packs a day.‚Äù - Dissonance produces mental discomfort, ranging from minor pangs to deep anguish; people don‚Äôt rest easy until they find a way to reduce it. - Self-justification is the usual mechanism by which people reduce dissonance. People become more certain about something they just did if they can‚Äôt undo it or if it came at some cost (time, money, effort etc). Information that is consonant with their belief / decision is accepted and conflicting information is considered biased. The first few chapters discuss the pyschology and scientific behaviour and how the brain and memory works. The rest of the book dives into specific examples of how self-justification manifests itself. The chapters on false memory and innocent people convicted of crimes are particularly powerful. A by-product of reading this book (at elast for me) is that it makes you examine your own deeply-held beliefs and look for evidence of self-justification. The challenge is that we are often blind to the lies we tell and have told ourselves so that self-justification may be very difficult to perceive."

On March 12, 2034, US Navy Commodore Sarah Hunt is on the bridge of her flagship, the guided missile destroyer USS John Paul Jones, conducting a routine freedom of navigation patrol in the South China Sea when her ship detects an unflagged trawler in clear distress, smoke billowing from its bridge. On that same day, US Marine aviator Major Chris ‚ÄúWedge‚Äù Mitchell is flying an F35E Lightning over the Strait of Hormuz, testing a new stealth technology as he flirts with Iranian airspace. By the end of that day, Wedge will be an Iranian prisoner, and Sarah Hunt‚Äôs destroyer will lie at the bottom of the sea, sunk by the Chinese Navy. Iran and China have clearly coordinated their moves, which involve the use of powerful new forms of cyber weaponry that render US ships and planes defenseless. In a single day, America‚Äôs faith in its military‚Äôs strategic pre-eminence is in tatters. A new, terrifying era is at hand. So begins a disturbingly plausible work of speculative fiction, co-authored by an award-winning novelist and decorated Marine veteran and the former commander of NATO, a legendary admiral who has spent much of his career strategically outmaneuvering America‚Äôs most tenacious adversaries. Written with a powerful blend of geopolitical sophistication and human empathy, 2034 takes us inside the minds of a global cast of characters‚ÄìAmericans, Chinese, Iranians, Russians, Indians ‚Äìas a series of arrogant miscalculations on all sides leads the world into an intensifying international storm. In the end, China and the United States will have paid a staggering cost, one that forever alters the global balance of power. Everything in 2034 is an imaginative extrapolation from present-day facts on the ground combined with the authors‚Äô years working at the highest and most classified levels of national security. Sometimes it takes a brilliant work of fiction to illuminate the most dire of warnings: 2034 is all too close at hand, and this cautionary tale presents the reader a dark yet possible future that we must do all we can to avoid."

I don‚Äôt necessarily agree with all the conclusions drawn by the author, and at times his knowledge seems shallow rather than deep on some of the subjects he discusses. The topic is very broad though so it‚Äôs hard to imagine anyone being an expert on all of it. I would just keep a few pinches of salt handy."

    "text": "The Holy Quran with Arabic Text and English Translation\n\n\ntranslated by Maulawi Sher Ali\nisbn-13: 9781848800229\nHardcover\nAs a Muslim from birth, I have, of course, read the Holy Quran multiple times. In adult life I try and read a few lines every day - in Arabic and English. During the month of Ramadhan, Muslims try and read the whole Quran (in Arabic). I have never quite managed to do, given the constraints of work and commuting, as well as the difficulty of reading the Arabic for a non-Arabic speaker. This year, working from home due to being in lockdown and not having to commute to work, I was able to get pretty close - I got through about 27 of the 30 parts of the Quran. (I finished the rest off in the weeks that followed.) Every day, I would read the Arabic for one ‚Äúpart‚Äù and then the English translation. Reading the whole Quran this way from front to back (rather than dipping in and out) gives you a better sense of the broader themes in the Quran. You read various portions of the story of Biblical prophets such Adam, Noah, Abraham, Joseph, Moses, David and Solomon interweaved with each other. There are non-Biblical stories giving the example of the peoples of Ad and Thamud and the prophet Saleh. The story of Mary and Jesus is also mentioned in numerous places in the Quran. Other than a chapter dedicated to the story of Joseph, the Quran never gives a complete narrative in one place - instead it uses the examples of different prophets in different places to make a point. Obviously I have some degree of bias, being a Muslim, but I do recommend non-Muslims to read the Quran with a good translation (such as this one). Although it shares many of the characters that are in the Bible, the overall feel and flow of the Quran is very different. You can read online or download PDF versions from alislam.org and get a physical copy from amibookstore.us."

Knowing that his adversary might punch him for what he was about to say, Liam responded. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre doing it for yourself.‚Äù New York Times best-selling author Patrick Lencioni has written a dozen books that focus on how leaders can build teams and lead organizations. In The Motive, he shifts his attention toward helping them understand the importance of why they‚Äôre leading in the first place. In what may be his edgiest page-turner to date, Lencioni thrusts his readers into a day-long conversation between rival CEOs. Shay Davis is the CEO of Golden Gate Alarm, who, after just a year in his role, is beginning to worry about his job and is desperate to figure out how to turn things around. With nowhere else to turn, Shay receives some hard-to-swallow advice from the most unlikely and unwanted source‚ÄîLiam Alcott, CEO of a more successful security company and his most hated opponent. Lencioni uses unexpected plot twists and crisp dialogue to take us on a journey that culminates in a resolution that is as unexpected as it is enlightening. As he does in his other books, he then provides a straightforward summary of the lessons from the fable, combining a clear explanation of his theory with practical advice to help executives examine their true motivation for leading. In addition to provoking readers to honestly assess themselves, Lencioni presents action steps for changing their approach in five key areas. In doing so, he helps leaders avoid the pitfalls that stifle their organizations and even hurt the people they are meant to serve.‚Äù"

    "text": "Boyd - The Fighter Pilot Who Changed The Art Of War by Robert Coram\n\n\nisbn-13: 9780316796880\nAudible\nJohn Boyd is probably up there in list of most influential Americans of the 20th Century that very few people have heard of. A great fighter pilot who then went on to design the F-15 and F-16 fighter aircraft and ended his career as a military theorist whose ideas the US successfully used in both Gulf Wars. Boyd was an iconoclast who continually found himself fighting the Air Force hierarchy. As well as in-depth biography of Boyd, the book also provides an eye-opening inside view of Military-Industrial complex that Eisenhower warned of. Boyd was deeply flawed in many ways but had a personal code of honor that guided him throughout his career. My favorite quote of Boyd‚Äôs from the book is:\n\n‚ÄúIf your boss demands loyalty, give him integrity. But if he demands integrity, then give him loyalty‚Äù\n\nThere are a small number of Audible books that I like so much that I buy a physical copy of the book. This is one of those books.\nAnother great quote:\n\n‚ÄúTo be somebody or to do something. In life there is often a roll call. That‚Äôs when you will have to make a decision. To be or to do? Which way will you go?‚Äù\n\nPublisher‚Äôs Description: ‚ÄúJohn Boyd may be the most remarkable unsung hero in all of American military history. Some remember him as the greatest U.S. fighter pilot ever ‚Äì the man who, in simulated air-to-air combat, defeated every challenger in less than forty seconds. Some recall him as the father of our country‚Äôs most legendary fighter aircraft ‚Äì the F-15 and F-16. Still others think of Boyd as the most influential military theorist since Sun Tzu. They know only half the story. Boyd, more than any other person, saved fighter aviation from the predations of the Strategic Air Command. His manual of fighter tactics changed the way every air force in the world flies and fights. He discovered a physical theory that forever altered the way fighter planes were designed. Later in life, he developed a theory of military strategy that has been adopted throughout the world and even applied to business models for maximizing efficiency. And in one of the most startling and unknown stories of modern military history, the Air Force fighter pilot taught the U.S. Marine Corps how to fight war on the ground. His ideas led to America‚Äôs swift and decisive victory in the Gulf War and foretold the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. On a personal level, Boyd rarely met a general he couldn‚Äôt offend. He was loud, abrasive, and profane. A man of daring, ferocious passion and intractable stubbornness, he was that most American of heroes ‚Äì a rebel who cared not for his reputation or fortune but for his country. He was a true patriot, a man who made a career of challenging the shortsighted and self-serving Pentagon bureaucracy. America owes Boyd and his disciples ‚Äì the six men known as the‚ÄùAcolytes‚Äù ‚Äì a great debt. Robert Coram finally brings to light the remarkable story of a man who polarized all who knew him, but who left a legacy that will influence the military ‚Äì and all of America ‚Äì for decades to come. ..‚Äù"

Is it true that fake news spreads because it‚Äôs an unstoppable mind virus? Actually, brute-force attacks on our attention, not manipulation, explain most of it. Exploring everything from the onset of riots to the power of Instagram influencers, Kucharski shows how hackneyed the popular understanding of virality can be, and how much more compelling the real story is. Whether you are an author seeking an audience, a defender of the truth, or simply someone interested in the science of human social behavior, The Rules of Contagion is essential guide to modern life.‚Äù"

Join a young CIA officer as he recruits a reluctant foreign agent. And sit with an accomplished surgeon as he tries, and fails, to convince yet another cancer patient to opt for the less risky course of treatment. In Supercommunicators, Charles Duhigg blends deep research and his trademark storytelling skills to show how we can all learn to identify and leverage the hidden layers that lurk beneath every conversation. Communication is a superpower and the best communicators understand that whenever we speak, we‚Äôre actually participating in one of three conversations: practical (What‚Äôs this really about?), emotional (How do we feel?), and social (Who are we?). If you don‚Äôt know what kind of conversation you‚Äôre having, you‚Äôre unlikely to connect. Supercommunicators know the importance of recognizing‚Äîand then matching‚Äîeach kind of conversation, and how to hear the complex emotions, subtle negotiations, and deeply held beliefs that color so much of what we say and how we listen. Our experiences, our values, our emotional lives‚Äîand how we see ourselves, and others‚Äîshape every discussion, from who will pick up the kids to how we want to be treated at work. In this book, you will learn why some people are able to make themselves heard, and to hear others, so clearly. With his storytelling that takes us from the writers‚Äô room of The Big Bang Theory to the couches of leading marriage counselors, Duhigg shows readers how to recognize these three conversations‚Äîand teaches us the tips and skills we need to navigate them more successfully. In the end, he delivers a simple but powerful lesson: With the right tools, we can connect with anyone."

The key concept is that we tend to judge a decision by the result that it produced - a positive result means it was a good decision, a negative result means it was a bad decision. In reality, you can get lucky and get a good result from a bad decision or unlucky and get a bad result from a good decision. We need to assess the quality of the decision using the a-priori information available at the time rather than the after-the-fact result. The author then elaborates on this using her experience as a professional-poker player to help us see decisions as bets on the future with our degree of confidence in the decision analagous to the betting-odds. Overall, an interesting read, but you could probably get 80% of the value by just reading a detailed review."

Spurred on by the obligation she felt to her working-class immigrant family, she rose through the ranks and saw it all: out-of-control, lavish parties flowing with never-ending drinks; affairs flouted in the office; rampant drug use; and most pervasively, a discriminatory culture that seemed designed to hold back the few women and people of color employed at the company. Despite Goldman Sachs having the right talking points and statistics, Fiore Higgins soon realized that these provided a veneer to cover up what she found to be an abusive culture. Her account is one filled with shocking stories of harassment and jaw-dropping tales of exclusionary behavior: when she was told she only got promoted because she is a woman; when her coworkers mooed at her after she pumped for her fourth child, defying the superior who had advised her not to breastfeed; or when a male boss used a racial epithet in front of her, other colleagues, and clients without any repercussions. Bully Market sounds the alarm on the culture of finance and corporate America, while offering clear, actionable ideas for creating a fairer workplace. Both a revealing, extraordinary look at the industry and a top Wall Streeter‚Äôs explosive personal story, Bully Market is an essential account of one woman‚Äôs experience in a flawed system that speaks to the challenge and urgency for change.‚Äù"

    "text": "Clear Thinking: Turning Ordinary Moments into Extraordinary Results by Shane Parrish\n\n\nisbn-13: 9780593086117\nKindle\nPublisher‚Äôs Description\nFew things will change your trajectory in life or business as much as learning to think clearly. Yet few of us recognize opportunities to think in the first place.\nYou might believe you‚Äôre thinking clearly in the moments that matter most. But in all likelihood, when the pressure is on, you won‚Äôt be thinking at all. And your subsequent actions will inevitably move you further from the results you ultimately seek‚Äîlove, belonging, success, wealth, victory. According to Farnam Street founder Shane Parrish, we must get better at recognizing these opportunities for what they are, and deploying our cognitive ability in order to achieve the life we want.\nClear Thinking gives you the tools to recognize the moments that have the potential to transform your trajectory, and reshape how you navigate the critical space between stimulus and response. As Parrish shows, we may imagine we are the protagonists in the story of our lives. But the sad truth is, most of us run on autopilot. Our behavioral defaults, groomed by biology, evolution, and culture, are primed to run the show for us if we don‚Äôt intervene. At our worst, we react to events without reasoning, not even realizing that we‚Äôve missed an opportunity to think at all. At our best, we recognize these moments for what they are, and apply the full capacity of our reasoning and rationality to them.\nThrough stories, mental models, and more, Parrish offers the missing link between behavioral science and real-life outcomes. The result is a must-have manual for optimizing decision-making, gaining competitive advantage, and living a more intentional life."

In this gripping account, David Quammen takes the reader along on this astonishing quest to learn how, where from, and why these diseases emerge and asks the terrifying question: What might the next big one be?‚Äù\nQuotes\n\nAny such spillover in the reverse direction‚Äîfrom humans to a nonhuman species‚Äîis known as an anthroponosis. The famous mountain gorillas, for instance, have been threatened by anthroponotic infections such as measles, carried by ecotourists who come to dote upon them.\n\n\nWith influenza and many other diseases the order is reversed, high infectivity preceding symptoms by a matter of days. A perverse pattern: the danger, then the warning. That probably helped account for the scale of worldwide misery and death during the 1918‚Äì1919 influenza: high infectivity among cases before they experienced the most obvious and debilitating stages of illness. The bug traveled ahead of the sense of alarm. And that infamous global pandemic, remember, occurred in the era before globalization. Everything nowadays moves around the planet faster, including viruses.\n\n\nThe much darker story remains to be told, probably not about this virus but about another. When the Next Big One comes, we can guess, it will likely conform to the same perverse pattern, high infectivity preceding notable symptoms. That will help it to move through cities and airports like an angel of death.\n\n\nThat‚Äôs the salubrious thing about zoonotic diseases: They remind us, as St.¬†Francis did, that we humans are inseparable from the natural world. In fact, there is no ‚Äúnatural world,‚Äù it‚Äôs a bad and artificial phrase. There is only the world. Humankind is part of that world, as are the ebolaviruses, as are the influenzas and the HIVs, as are Nipah and Hendra and SARS, as are chimpanzees and bats and palm civets and bar-headed geese, as is the next murderous virus‚Äîthe one we haven‚Äôt yet detected.\n\n\nindividual effort, individual discernment, individual choice can have huge effects in averting the catastrophes that might otherwise sweep through a herd."

Who would you rather decides your future - an algorithm or a human? Before making your decision, bear in mind that the algorithm will always be more consistent, and far less prone to an error of judgement. Then again, at least the human will be able to look you in the eye before determining your fate. How much fairness would you be willing to sacrifice for that human touch? This is just one of the dilemmas we face in the age of the algorithm, where the machine rules supreme, telling us what to watch, where to go, even who to send to prison. As increasingly we rely on them to automate big, important decisions - in crime, healthcare, transport, money - they raise questions that cut to the heart of what we want our society to look like, forcing us to decide what matters most. Is helping doctors to diagnose patients more or less important than preserving our anonymity? Should we prevent people from becoming victims of crime, or protect innocent people from being falsely accused? Hannah Fry takes us on a tour through the good, the bad, and the downright ugly of the algorithms that surround us. In Hello World she lifts the lid on their inner workings, demonstrates their power, exposes their limitations, and examines whether they really are an improvement on the human systems they replace."

I was asked to describe my book, Yearbook, for the inside flap (which is a gross phrase) and for websites and shit like that, so‚Ä¶ here it goes!!! Yearbook is a collection of true stories that I desperately hope are just funny at worst, and life-changingly amazing at best. (I understand that it‚Äôs likely the former, which is a fancy ‚Äúbook‚Äù way of saying ‚Äúthe first one.‚Äù) I talk about my grandparents, doing stand-up comedy as a teenager, bar mitzvahs, and Jewish summer camp, and tell way more stories about doing drugs than my mother would like. I also talk about some of my adventures in Los Angeles, and surely say things about other famous people that will create a wildly awkward conversation for me at a party one day. I hope you enjoy the book should you buy it, and if you don‚Äôt enjoy it, I‚Äôm sorry. If you ever see me on the street and explain the situation, I‚Äôll do my best to make it up to you. *I was beaten by Bill O‚ÄôReilly, which really sucks.‚Äù"

    "text": "The Right It by Alberto Savoia\n\n\nisbn-13: 9780062884657\nHardcover\nAlbert Savoia makes a compelling case for how to improve the odds of your new product succeeding in the marketplace, with a number of practical tips and tools to go along with the theory.\n\nTheory\n‚Ä¢ The Law of Market Failure: Most new ideas will fail in the market-even if competently executed.\n‚Ä¢ Most new ideas fail in the market because they are The Wrong It-ideas that the market is not interested in regardless of how well they are executed.\n‚Ä¢ Your best chance for succeeding in the market is to combine an idea that is The Right It with competent execution.\n‚Ä¢ You cannot depend on your intuition, other people‚Äôs opinions, or other people‚Äôs data to determine if a new idea is The Right It.\n‚Ä¢ The most reliable way to determine if a new idea is likely to be The Right It is to collect Your Own DAta (YODA).\n\n\nXYZ Hypothesis\nAt least X% of Y will Z.\nX% is a specific percentage of your target market. Y is a clear description of your target market. Z is how you expect the market will engage with your idea.\n\n\nHypozooming\nThe goal of hypozooming is to take a specific but broad hypothesis and zoom in until you have a version of that hypothesis that is actionable and testable right now. It‚Äôs a way to go from XYZ to xyz, a smaller, simpler, more immediately verifiable version of your Market Engagement Hypothesis. The idea is that if XYZ is true, then xyz must also be true-but xyz is much easier to test and verify.\n\n\nPretotypes\nPrototypes and pretotypes serve different functions. Prototypes are primarily designed to test if an idea for a product or service can be built, how it should be built, how (and if) it will work, what‚Äôs the best size or shape for it, and so on.\nPretotypes, on the other hand, are designed primarily to validate, quickly and cheaply, if an idea is worth pursuing and building in the first place -a different objective that is best accomplished with a different set of techniques and best served by having its own vocabulary.\n\n\nTRI Meter\nThe Right It Meter, TRI Meter for short, is a visual analysis tool to help you interpret the YODA you‚Äôve collected as objectively as possible. More precisely, the TRI Meter is a gauge to help you estimate how likely it is that an idea will succeed in the market, but it‚Äôs a gauge that is not too technical, complicated, or confusing - which can easily happen whenever probability and statistics are involved.\n\n\nSkin-in-the-game Caliper\nAssign skin-in-the-game ‚Äúpoints‚Äù to different types of target market responses. The caliper can be customized for specific products and markets.\n\n\nOverall process\n\nStart with an idea.\nIdentify the Market Engagement Hypothesis.\nTurn the MEH into a say-it-with-numbers XYZ Hypothesis.\nHypozoom into a set of smaller, easier to test xyx hypotheses.\nUse pretotyping techniques to run experiments and collect YODA.\nUse the TRI Meter with the Skin-in-the-Game Caliper to help you analyze the YODA.\nDecide on the next step:\n\n\nGo for it! You can‚Äôt be 100% sure that your idea is The Right It, but the YODA looks promising enough for you to take a calculated risk.\nDrop it. As much as you‚Äôd like your idea to succeed, the YODA stubbornly indicates otherwise.\nTweak it. In the process of testing your idea, you have learned invaluable things about your target market and its willingness (or unwillingness) to engage with your product. Don‚Äôt hesitate to tweak your original idea (or your hypotheses) to reflect what you‚Äôve learned along the way. You may find that although there is not enough market interest in your original idea, there may be great interest in something related to it. Or try flipping the idea on its head and see what you come up with.\n\nPublisher‚Äôs Description: ‚ÄúThe Law of Market Failure: Most new products will fail in the market, even if competently executed. Using his experience at Google, his remarkable success as an entrepreneur and consultant, and insights from his lectures at Stanford University and Google, Alberto Savoia‚Äôs The Right It offers an unparalleled approach to beating the beast that is market failure. Millions of people around the world are working hard to bring to life new ideas. Some of these ideas will turn out to be stunning successes that will have a major impact on our world and our culture: The next Google, the next Polio vaccine, the next Harry Potter, the next Red Cross, the next Ford Mustang. Others will be smaller, more personal but no less meaningful, successes: A little restaurant that becomes a neighborhood favorite, a biography that does not make the best-seller list but tells an important story, a local nonprofit to care for abandoned pets. At this very same moment, another group of people is working equally hard to develop new ideas that, when launched, will fail. Some of them will fail spectacularly and publicly: like New Coke, the movie ‚ÄúJohn Carter‚Äù, or the Ford Edsel. Others will be smaller, more private, but no less painful failures: A home-based business that never takes off, a children‚Äôs book that neither publishers nor children have any interest in, a charity for a cause that too few people care enough about. If you are currently working to develop a new idea, whether on your own or as part of a team, which group are you in? Most people believe that they either are, or will be, in the first group‚Äîthe group whose ideas will be successful. All they have to do is work hard and execute well. Unfortunately, we know that this cannot be the case. The law of market failure tells us that up to 90 percent of most new products, services, businesses, and initiatives will fail soon after they are launched‚Äîregardless of how promising they sound, how much we commit to them, or how well we execute them. This is a hard fact to accept. We believe that other people fail because they don‚Äôt know what they are doing. Somehow, we believe that this does not apply to us and to our idea‚Äîespecially if we‚Äôve experienced victories in the past. Filled with detailed case studies, a lesson on creating your own hard data, a strategy for market engagement, and an introduction to the concept of a pretotype (not a prototype), The Right It is a groundbreaking, entertaining, and highly practical book delivers a proven formula for turning ideas, products, services, and businesses into successful endeavors. As Alberto writes, ‚Äúmake sure you are building The Right It before you build It right‚Äù.‚Äù"

Their papers showed the ways in which the human mind erred, systematically, when forced to make judgments in uncertain situations. Their work created the field of behavioral economics, revolutionized Big Data studies, advanced evidence-based medicine, led to a new approach to government regulation, and made much of Michael Lewis‚Äôs own work possible. Kahneman and Tversky are more responsible than anybody for the powerful trend to mistrust human intuition and defer to algorithms. The Undoing Project is about a compelling collaboration between two men who have the dimensions of great literary figures. They became heroes in the university and on the battlefield‚Äìboth had important careers in the Israeli military‚Äìand their research was deeply linked to their extraordinary life experiences. Amos Tversky was a brilliant, self- confident warrior and extrovert, the center of rapt attention in any room; Kahneman, a fugitive from the Nazis in his childhood, was an introvert whose questing self-doubt was the seedbed of his ideas. They became one of the greatest partnerships in the history of science, working together so closely that they couldn‚Äôt remember whose brain originated which ideas, or who should claim credit. They flipped a coin to decide the lead authorship on the first paper they wrote, and simply alternated thereafter. This story about the workings of the human mind is explored through the personalities of two fascinating individuals so fundamentally different from each other that they seem unlikely friends or colleagues. In the process they may well have changed, for good, mankind‚Äôs view of its own mind.‚Äù"

It certainly gave me insight into points of view and experiences I had not come across before.\nOstensibly the ‚Äúsomebody‚Äù of the title is Ford‚Äôs father who has been in jail for most of her childhood, but the book really highlights Ford‚Äôs troubled relationship with her mother.\nI was reminded of Educated by Tara Westover in many way as I was reading this, but Ford‚Äôs experiences and troubles are tame compared to Westover‚Äôs. This might be unfair, but Ford comes across as a little immature - I wonder if her perspective would change if she herself becomes a mother.\nNevertheless, a worthwhile read.\nPublisher‚Äôs Description: ‚Äú‚ÄúSure to be one of the best memoirs of 2021.‚Äù ‚ÄîKirkus Reviews, starred review ‚ÄúSo clear, sharp, and smooth that the reader sees, in vivid focus, Ford‚Äôs complicated childhood, brilliant mind, and golden heart.

Through poverty, adolescence, and a fraught relationship with her mother, Ashley Ford wishes she could turn to her father for hope and encouragement. There are just a few problems: he‚Äôs in prison, and she doesn‚Äôt know what he did to end up there. She doesn‚Äôt know how to deal with the incessant worries that keep her up at night, or how to handle the changes in her body that draw unwanted attention from men. In her search for unconditional love, Ashley begins dating a boy her mother hates. When the relationship turns sour, he assaults her. Still reeling from the rape, which she keeps secret from her family, Ashley desperately searches for meaning in the chaos. Then, her grandmother reveals the truth about her father‚Äôs incarceration . . . and Ashley‚Äôs entire world is turned upside down. Somebody‚Äôs Daughter steps into the world of growing up a poor, Black girl in Indiana with a family fragmented by incarceration, exploring how isolating and complex such a childhood can be. As Ashley battles her body and her environment, she embarks on a powerful journey to find the threads between who she is and what she was born into, and the complicated familial love that often binds them.‚Äù"

    "text": "Ubiquity: Why Catastrophes Happen by Mark Buchanan - (Kindle)\n\n\nOne of the books that were covered by the Farnam Street Virtual Reading Group in 2017. The book gave an interesting non-technical introduction to Critical State Theory and how it can be used to explain phenomena as diverse as earthquakes, forest fires, extinction events, financial markets and wars. Focusing initially on earthquakes, the book explains how scientists have singularly failed to come up with a theory that can predict when and where a major earhtquake will occur. Instead, scientists have found that earthquakes in general follow a power-law that describes how earthquake magnitude relates to frequency - the larger the earthquake, the less likely it is to occur. However, any size of earhquake can occur at any given time. How I understood it, is that complex systems with many interacting elements behave in a highly-path dependent manner and can build up to a critical state where a small ‚Äònudge‚Äô can cause a very large change in the overall behavior, but could also just precipitate a very small change.\nThis book definitely left me looking at the world in a different way. The concepts have many potential repercussions to how we see the world and how we interact with it. A book to come back to for a second read."

Easy, short read that is valuable for anyone working in a team (which is pretty much everyone).\nPublisher‚Äôs Description: ‚ÄúThe New York Times best-selling team leadership handbook for modern executives, managers, and organizations After her first two weeks observing the problems at DecisionTech, Kathryn Petersen, its new CEO, had more than a few moments when she wondered if she should have taken the job. But Kathryn knew there was little chance she would have turned it down. After all, retirement had made her antsy, and nothing excited her more than a challenge. What she could not have known when she accepted the job, however, was just how dysfunctional her team was, and how team members would challenge her in ways that no one ever had before. For twenty years, The Five Dysfunctions of a Team has been engaging audiences with a page- turning, realistic fable that follows the travails of Kathryn Petersen, DecisionTech‚Äôs CEO, as she faces the ultimate leadership crisis. She must unite a team in such disarray that it threatens to derail the entire company. Equal parts leadership fable and business handbook, this definitive source on teamwork by Patrick Lencioni reveals the five behavioral tendencies that go to the heart of why even the best teams struggle. He offers a powerful model and step-by-step guide for overcoming those dysfunctions and getting every one rowing in the same direction. Today, the lessons in The Five Dysfunctions of a Team are more relevant than ever.

From the New York Times bestselling author of Chasing the Scream and Lost Connections comes a groundbreaking examination of why this is happening‚Äîand how to get our attention back. ‚ÄúThe book the world needs in order to win the war on distraction.‚Äù‚ÄîAdam Grant, author of Think Again ‚ÄúRead this book to save your mind.‚Äù‚ÄîSusan Cain, author of Quiet ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR: The Wall Street Journal In the United States, teenagers can focus on one task for only sixty-five seconds at a time, and office workers average only three minutes. Like so many of us, Johann Hari was finding that constantly switching from device to device and tab to tab was a diminishing and depressing way to live. He tried all sorts of self-help solutions‚Äîeven abandoning his phone for three months‚Äîbut nothing seemed to work. So Hari went on an epic journey across the world to interview the leading experts on human attention‚Äîand he discovered that everything we think we know about this crisis is wrong. We think our inability to focus is a personal failure to exert enough willpower over our devices. The truth is even more disturbing: our focus has been stolen by powerful external forces that have left us uniquely vulnerable to corporations determined to raid our attention for profit. Hari found that there are twelve deep causes of this crisis, from the decline of mind-wandering to rising pollution, all of which have robbed some of our attention. In Stolen Focus, he introduces readers to Silicon Valley dissidents who learned to hack human attention, and veterinarians who diagnose dogs with ADHD. He explores a favela in Rio de Janeiro where everyone lost their attention in a particularly surreal way, and an office in New Zealand that discovered a remarkable technique to restore workers‚Äô productivity. Crucially, Hari learned how we can reclaim our focus‚Äîas individuals, and as a society‚Äîif we are determined to fight for it. Stolen Focus will transform the debate about attention and finally show us how to get it back."

There‚Äôs no grand theory or overarching narrative though.\nChapter 1: ‚ÄúOn Washing Hands‚Äù discusses why the discovery by Semmelweis in 1847 that having doctors wash their hands in between deliveries greatly reduced infections took so long to be adopted by the medical community as standard practice. Introduces the concept of positive deviance\nChapter 2: ‚ÄúThe Mop Up‚Äù shows the difficulties faced by doctors on the front line of polio containment in India.\nChapter 3: ‚ÄúCasualties of War‚Äù covers the ongoing improvement in care for soldiers wounded on the battlefield. Chapter 4: ‚ÄúNaked‚Äù covers exam room etiquette especially when performing intimate examinations and whether having ‚Äòchaperones‚Äô improves the situation or not.\nChapter 5: ‚ÄúWhat Doctors Owe‚Äù discusses malpractice suits which pits doctors against insurers.\nChapter 6: ‚ÄúPiecework‚Äù concerns how much doctors earn and their relationship with the health insurance industry.\nChapter 7: ‚ÄúThe Doctors of the Death Chamber‚Äù discusses death by lethal injection and the doctors that administer or oversee the procedure and the related ethics.\nChapter 8: ‚ÄúOn Fighting‚Äù discussed the pros and cons of fighting to treat or save patients when the side-effects can be debilitating or the chances of success are slim.\nChapter 9: ‚ÄúThe Score‚Äù dives into childbirth and the complications that can arrive. It discusses the invention of the forceps and why it is so rarely used nowadays. The score is a reference to the Apgar Score, a way of ‚Äòmeasuring‚Äô a child‚Äôs chances of survival after birth and the different means that doctors have come up with to improve those chances.\nChapter 10: ‚ÄúThe Bell Curve‚Äù discusses hospital performance in combatting different diseases and what some hospitals do so that they outperform others.\nChapter 11: ‚ÄúFor Performance‚Äù highlights difficulties faced by doctors in Indian hospitals where patients often die of treatable causes because of the lack of appropriate instruments.\nAfterword: ‚ÄúSuggestions for Becoming a Positive Deviant‚Äù - see this summary\nPublisher‚Äôs Description: ‚ÄúExplores the efforts of physicians to close the gap between best intentions and best performance in the face of insurmountable obstacles, discussing such topics as the ethical considerations of lethal injections, malpractice, and surgical errors.‚Äù"

The media loves to report on millions, billions, and trillions, but frequently makes basic mistakes or presents such numbers in misleading ways. And misunderstanding numbers can have serious consequences, since they can deceive us in many of our most important decisions, including how to vote, what to buy, and whether to make a financial investment. In this short, accessible, enlightening, and entertaining book, leading computer scientist Brian Kernighan teaches anyone‚Äîeven diehard math-phobes‚Äîhow to demystify the numbers that assault us every day. With examples drawn from a rich variety of sources, including journalism, advertising, and politics, Kernighan demonstrates how numbers can mislead and misrepresent. In chapters covering big numbers, units, dimensions, and more, he lays bare everything from deceptive graphs to speciously precise numbers. And he shows how anyone‚Äîusing a few basic ideas and lots of shortcuts‚Äîcan easily learn to recognize common mistakes, determine whether numbers are credible, and make their own sensible estimates when needed. Giving you the simple tools you need to avoid being fooled by dubious numbers, Millions, Billions, Zillions is an essential survival guide for a world drowning in big‚Äîand often bad‚Äîdata.‚Äù"

It also gives a very interesting account of Renaissance Technologies senior executive, Robert Mercer, a former computer scientist working at IBM before coming to work for Simons at Renaissance. The book narrates how Mercer became enamored of right-wing conspiracy theories and used his wealth to fund right-wing website Breitbart and persuade Donald Trump to bring Steve Bannon and Kelly Conway on to his team at a low point in his 2016 presidential campaign.

Jim Simons is the greatest money maker in modern financial history. No other investor‚ÄìWarren Buffett, Peter Lynch, Ray Dalio, Steve Cohen, or George Soros‚Äìcan touch his record. Since 1988, Renaissance‚Äôs signature Medallion fund has generated average annual returns of 66 percent. The firm has earned profits of more than $100 billion; Simons is worth twenty-three billion dollars. Drawing on unprecedented access to Simons and dozens of current and former employees, Zuckerman, a veteran Wall Street Journal investigative reporter, tells the gripping story of how a world-class mathematician and former code breaker mastered the market. Simons pioneered a data-driven, algorithmic approach that‚Äôs sweeping the world. As Renaissance became a market force, its executives began influencing the world beyond finance. Simons became a major figure in scientific research, education, and liberal politics. Senior executive Robert Mercer is more responsible than anyone else for the Trump presidency, placing Steve Bannon in the campaign and funding Trump‚Äôs victorious 2016 effort. Mercer also impacted the campaign behind Brexit. The Man Who Solved the Market is a portrait of a modern-day Midas who remade markets in his own image, but failed to anticipate how his success would impact his firm and his country.

Each book typically also has a section where the model is also presented in a more conventional manner. I found the books easy to read and a good way of conveying the message that Lencioni is trying to deliver. It‚Äôs perhaps not everyone‚Äôs cup-of-tea, but it works for me.\nThe Ideal Team Player is perhaps not his best work, but nevertheless a worthwhile read with some interesting points to make. I wouldn‚Äôt start here if you are coming fresh to Lencioni (I would recommend trying Five Dysfunctions of Team first) but if you have read his other books, you‚Äôll likely enjoy this too.\n\nModel\n\nThe Three Virtues\n\nHumility: Humility is the single most important attribute of a team player. Great team players lack excessive ego or concerns about status.

It is the ability to be interpersonally approriate and aware.\n\nAn ideal team player has all three virtues combined. If even one virtue is missing, teamwork becomes much more difficult if not impossible.\n\nHumble only: The Pawn\nHungry only: The Bulldozer\nSmart only: The Charmer\nHungry and Humble, but not Smart: The Accidental Mess-Maker\nHumble and Smart, but not Hungry: The Lovable Slacker\nHungry and Smart, but not Humble: The Skillful Politician"

In Lords of Finance, we meet these men, the four bankers who truly broke the world: the enigmatic Norman Montagu of the bank of England, Benjamin Strong of the NY Federal Reserve, the arrogant yet brilliant Hjalmar Schacht of the Reichsbanlk and the xenophobic Emile Moreau of the Banque de France. Their names were lost to history, their lives and actions forgotten, until now.

    "text": "How We Change by Ross Ellenhorn\n\n\nisbn-13: 9780062961112\nAudible\n\nPersonal change is always a courageous act.\n\nThis is ‚Äòchange‚Äô from the viewpoint of a psychotherapist and should probably be more accurately titled ‚Äúwhy we don‚Äôt change‚Äù. It focuses mostly on changing negative or toxic behaviors rather changing our thoughts and beliefs.\nEllenhorn claims we are wired to double down on the familiar because of what he calls the ‚ÄúFear of Hope‚Äù - the act of protecting ourselves from further disappointment.\nHe identifies the ‚Äú10 Reasons Not to Change‚Äù to help us see why we behave the way we do when we are faced with the ‚Äúchallenge of hope‚Äù:\n\nRaising one‚Äôs own expectations about change: When we change something for the better, we always risk disappointing ourselves if we can‚Äôt maintain the change.\nRaising the expectations of others: By making a positive change in one‚Äôs life, a person not only raises his own expectations; he inevitably raises the expectations of others. Doing so, he risks that others will witness his failure to maintain the new, more positive status he has achieved.\nFacing where you are in life: Progressive change requires that individuals assess what they need to change, and thus confront the current state of the lives they have authored.\nTaking ‚Äúsmall steps‚Äù: To change his circumstances, a person is not merely required to face where he is in that moment, but to do so repetitively, as he takes the incremental steps towards a goal. Each step is a reminder of where he is and how far he has to go to reach his goals.\nBeing accountable for ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs next‚Äù: Each change a person makes testifies that she is accountable for the life that lies ahead. The more she changes, the more the outcome of her life is seen as within her power.\nFacing the unknown: By enacting change in one‚Äôs life, a person faces the unknown possibilities of a life that is in his hands. When we enact change, we must contend not only with an unpredictable world, but also with the unpredictability of the future created in part by our own actions.\nExistential aloneness: Change always makes us face our own aloneness. Enacting change, a person recognizes that she alone is the author of her life, the originator of things she has made happen in the past, what she is making happen now, and what she will make happen in the future.\nLosing a social support: When a person makes positive changes in her treatment, she inevitably steps on a path that leads out of treatment, and thus away from prior therapeutic relationships.\nDestroying the negatives: Keeping his behavior the same is his only means of protecting an enduring memorial to the past. Changing this behavior is like demolishing his memorial.\nConditional aloneness in the presence of others: Therapists and therapeutic communities offer enduring recognition to those they treat, providing their clients the important sense that they exist in the mind‚Äôs eyes of someone else even when they are out of physical sight. And they often provide this continuous attention without the pressures of expectations regarding accountability.\n\nPublisher‚Äôs Description: ‚ÄúA paradigm-shifting, instant classic in the making that challenges our assumptions about change by encouraging us to understand and embrace our resistance to it. We all have something we want to change about ourselves. But whether it‚Äôs quitting smoking, losing weight, or breaking some common bad habit or negative behavior pattern, we feel a sense of failure when we don‚Äôt succeed. This often sets off a cascade of negative feelings and discouragement, making it even harder to change. The voice in our head tells us: Why bother? Successful change depends far more on understanding why we don‚Äôt change, psychotherapist and sociologist Ross Ellenhorn insists. His decades-long career as a pioneer in helping people overcome extreme psychiatric experiences and problematic substance use issues‚Äì especially those whom the behavioral healthcare system has failed‚Äì especially those whom the mental healthcare system has failed‚Äìhas lead him to develop an effective, long-term method to achieve transformation, from the simplest shifts to the most profound. In How We Change, Ellenhorn looks to the evolutionary imperatives driving us. We are wired to double down on the familiar because of what he calls the Fear of Hope‚Äìthe act of protecting ourselves from further disappointment. He identifies the‚Äù10 Reasons Not to Change‚Äù to help us see why we behave the way we do, making it clear that there is nothing broken inside us‚Äìit‚Äôs how we‚Äôre built. By addressing this little known reality, he gives us hope and helps us work toward the change we seek. Ellenhorn speaks to the core of our insecurities and fears about ourselves, with a humor and kindness. By turning our judgements about self-destructive behaviors into curious questions about them, he teaches us to think about our actions to discover what we truly want‚Äìeven if we‚Äôre going about getting it in the wrong way. How We Change is a brilliant approach that will forever alter our perspective‚Äìand help us achieve the transformation we truly seek.‚Äù"

Compared to Mike Duncan‚Äôs The Storm Before The Storm, Beard spends more time on what life was like for the average Roman at various points in Rome‚Äôs history. It has a much broader range than Duncan‚Äôs book, so seems to gloss over many of the events that Duncan discusses in great detail.

That‚Äôs how I felt: Her book took me to strange depths I never imagined, and I was smitten.‚Äù ‚ÄîThe New York Times Book Review David Starr Jordan was a taxonomist, a man possessed with bringing order to the natural world. In time, he would be credited with discovering nearly a fifth of the fish known to humans in his day. But the more of the hidden blueprint of life he uncovered, the harder the universe seemed to try to thwart him. His specimen collections were demolished by lightning, by fire, and eventually by the 1906 San Francisco earthquake‚Äîwhich sent more than a thousand discoveries, housed in fragile glass jars, plummeting to the floor. In an instant, his life‚Äôs work was shattered. Many might have given up, given in to despair. But Jordan? He surveyed the wreckage at his feet, found the first fish that he recognized, and confidently began to rebuild his collection. And this time, he introduced one clever innovation that he believed would at last protect his work against the chaos of the world. When NPR reporter Lulu Miller first heard this anecdote in passing, she took Jordan for a fool‚Äîa cautionary tale in hubris, or denial. But as her own life slowly unraveled, she began to wonder about him. Perhaps instead he was a model for how to go on when all seemed lost. What she would unearth about his life would transform her understanding of history, morality, and the world beneath her feet. Part biography, part memoir, part scientific adventure, Why Fish Don‚Äôt Exist is a wondrous fable about how to persevere in a world where chaos will always prevail."

By learning from the best, of course. From creating brand value to fine-tuning customer service, the folks running cartels have been attentive students of the strategy and tactics used by corporations such as Walmart, McDonald‚Äôs, and Coca-Cola. And what can government learn to combat this scourge?

The cast of characters includes ‚ÄúBin Laden,‚Äù the Bolivian coca guide; ‚ÄúOld Lin,‚Äù the Salvadoran gang leader; ‚ÄúStarboy,‚Äù the millionaire New Zealand pill maker; and a cozy Mexican grandmother who cooks blueberry pancakes while plotting murder.

More than just an investigation of how drug cartels do business, Narconomics is also a blueprint for how to defeat them."

    "text": "The Trespasser: A Novel by Tana French\n\n\nAlong with Michael Connelly, the other crime fiction writer that I eagerly await each new release from is Tana French. She‚Äôs nowhere near as prolific as Connelly - I think this is her sixth novel. Each novel is set in Ireland, most of them cases for the (fictitious) Dublin Murder Squad. Each novel takes a minor character from the previous book and makes him or her the main protagonist in the new book.\nI just love her writing and the edgy, slightly creepy atmosphere she manages to create. Most of her novels so far have had a shadow of the supernatural hanging over them without quite losing touch with reality - just enough to make you wonder if something not quite natural is at play. Her last novel, The Secret Place probably probably had the most overtly supernatural elements, whereas this novel probably has the least. The other element to most of her novels to date is that the protagonist in each somehow comes undone in some way, even as he or she solves the case, some fatal flow in their character causes their victory to turn out hollow in some way. That‚Äôs one of the things I‚Äôve really liked in her work. The Trespasser goes easier on the protagonists than her previous work - there‚Äôs no personal tragedy awaiting them at the end, which is good and bad. This seems to be her most straight-up detective story of her novels so far. Overall, though, another excellent novel from Tana French - can‚Äôt wait for the next one!"

The first rocket will take five minutes to hit London. You have six minutes to stop the second. Rudi Graf is an engineer who always dreamed of sending rockets to the moon. But instead, he finds himself working alongside Wernher von Braun, launching V2 rockets at London for the Nazis from a bleak seaside town in occupied Holland. As the SS increases its scrutiny on the project, Graf, an engineer more than a soldier, has to muster all of his willpower to toe the party line. And when rumors of a defector circulate through the German ranks, Graf becomes a prime suspect. Meanwhile, Kay Caton-Walsh, a young English intelligence officer, is living through the turmoil of war. After she and her lover, an RAF officer, are caught in a V2 attack, she volunteers to ship out for newly liberated Belgium.

    "text": "The Effective Manager by Mark Horstman\nI started listening to the Manager Tools podcast (Mark Horstman and Mike Auzenne) over ten years ago and am a big fan of their no-nonsense, practical approach to management. I paid for myself to attend one of their Effective Manager conferences (although I think it was called something different back them) when I worked in Chicago. So when I heard that Mark Horstman was going to release a book, I made sure to order a copy. In fact I got both a signed hardcover as well as the eBook for reference on the go. I even gave a copy to every person on my former management team when I moved roles. I don‚Äôt necessarily agree with all their advice - and they are very opinionated - but I appreciate that their advice is detailed and actionable. They‚Äôve really thought through this stuff.\nThough the book is relatively slim - the podcast material collected over 10 years is voluminous and wouldn‚Äôt fit in a single volume - this book covers the core Manager Tools guidance. For me the heart of the book is actually in the Afterword, and is probably the core reason why I like these guys so much:\nHighly recommended for any manager or wanna-be manager."

This book was engaging from the beginning, a tough modern-day crime story with heart and depth - a bit like the main character. I listened to the audiobook and the narrator, Ari Fliakos, gave an excellent performance."

In turn, this rallying cry or ‚Äúthematic goal‚Äù serves to align employees throughout the organization and provides an objective tool for resetting direction when things get out of sync. While it is useful for companies to have both a long term vision and a set of short term, tactical objectives, the thematic goal is intended to bridge the two. It makes the vision more tangible and it gives the tactical objectives more context. For the thematic goal to take root in an organization, it needs to originate at the executive team level. Once the thematic goal is set for the organization, each department can then create a corresponding thematic goal.\nDefinitions\n\n\nThematic Goal\nA single, qualitative focus or rallying cry that is shared by the entire leadership team and ultimately, by the entire organization-and that applies for only a specified period of time.\n\n\nDefining Objectives\nThe temporary, qualitative components that serve to clarify exactly what is meant by the Thematic Goal; shared by all members of the team (and usually varying in number from four to six).\n\n\nStandard Operating Objectives\nOther key objectives that an executive team must focus on and monitor.

Journalist M√≥nica Guzm√°n is the loving liberal daughter of Mexican immigrants who voted‚Äîtwice‚Äîfor Donald Trump. When the country could no longer see straight across the political divide, M√≥nica set out to find what was blinding us and discovered the most eye-opening tool we‚Äôre not using: our own built-in curiosity. Partisanship is up, trust is down, and our social media feeds make us sure we‚Äôre right and everyone else is ignorant (or worse). But avoiding one another is hurting our relationships and our society. In this timely, personal guide, M√≥nica, the chief storyteller for the national cross-partisan depolarization organization Braver Angels, takes you to the real front lines of a crisis that threatens to grind America to a halt‚Äîbroken conversations among confounded people. She shows you how to overcome the fear and certainty that surround us to finally do what only seems impossible: understand and even learn from people in your life whose whole worldview is different from or even opposed to yours. Drawing from cross-partisan conversations she‚Äôs had, organized, or witnessed everywhere from the echo chambers on social media to the wheat fields in Oregon to raw, unfiltered fights with her own family on election night, M√≥nica shows how you can put your natural sense of wonder to work for you immediately, finding the answers you need by talking with people‚Äîrather than about them‚Äîand asking the questions you want, curiously. In these pages, you‚Äôll learn: How to ask what you really want to know (even if you‚Äôre afraid to) How to grow smarter from even the most tense interactions, online or off How to cross boundaries and find common ground‚Äîwith anyone Whether you‚Äôre left, right, center, or not a fan of labels: If you‚Äôre ready to fight back against the confusion, heartbreak, and madness of our dangerously divided times‚Äîin your own life, at least‚ÄîM√≥nica‚Äôs got the tools and fresh, surprising insights to prove that seeing where people are coming from isn‚Äôt just possible.

    "text": "The Song of the Dodo: Island Biogeography in an Age of Extinctions by David Quammen\n\n\nI read this at it was chosen as the first book for the Farnam Street Blog Virtual Reading Group. It‚Äôs unlikely to be something I would have naturally read otherwise, but it turned out to be fascinating read.\nThe book is essentially a tour through the birth of the theory of evolution, through to island biogeography and conservation biology. You get to meet the scientists at the heart of these developments from Alfred Russel Wallace and Charles Darwin, to E.O. Wilson, Jared Diamond and many others. You also get to tour the world from Indonesia to the Galapagos to Madagascar to Tasmania and many other places. You also get to meet many different species of animal, some of which are now extinct and many of which may be on their way. It‚Äôs a long book, but never boring.\nThe book is replete with interesting stories. Although almost everyone has heard of the Dodo, another animal mentioned in the book is the Passenger Pigeon. Now extinct, there were 3-5 billion of them in North America in the 18th and 19th centuries, but they became extinct by 1900.\nHaving only ever studied a minimal amount of biology at school, I really only had a shallow understanding of evolution and how new species are created. My understanding is much improved after reading this book, though it has now opened a whole new set of questions for me.\nOne other benefit in reading this book is that you‚Äôll pick up a plethora of new and interesting words for your vocabulary. This is where the Kindle really comes in handy, as you can just highlight a word to bring up the dictionary entry for it. Unfortunately, I didn‚Äôt make note of those interesting words as I was reading and can no longer remember any of them - a lesson for the future. Going forwards I will be adding all the interesting words to my notes for the book on the kindle."

    "text": "Chaos Monkeys: Obscene Fortune and Random Failure in Silicon Valley by Antonio Garcia Martinez\nDisrupted: My Misadventure in the Start-Up Bubble by Dan Lyons\nThe Hard Thing About Hard Things: Building a Business When There Are No Easy Answers by Ben Horowitz\n\nThree books set in startup land, each with a very different perspective on the startup experience. The most enjoyable of the books is Chaos Monkeys. The author, Antonio Garcia Martinez, describes his journey from being a Strat at Goldman Sachs to moving to join an advertising startup in Silicon Valley to founding his own startup to selling the company to Twitter while engineering a job for himself at Facebook to his ultimate ejection from Facebook. He comes across as quite a rascal, super-smart, ascerbic and driven; someone who doesn‚Äôt suffer fools gladly and by his account he comes across a lot of fools on his journey.\nFor me the most interesting part of the book was the short period running his own startup - breaking free of the company he was working for, getting accepted into Y-Combinator, dealing with angel investors and VCs, to being acqui-hired by Twitter (with the twist that he himself is acqui-hired by Facebook). I found it fascinating and educational even without all the salacious insider-gossip-type details the author throws in.\nI was less impressed by Disrupted, the story of an old-school writer/editor who gets laid off by Newsweek and decides to venture into startup land, albeit in Boston rather than Silicon Valley. I think I was put off by the snarky, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm the only sane person in the building‚Äù tone to the book - you could sense an almost continuous rolling of the eyes. There‚Äôs definitely another side to this story that I would be interested in hearing about. That being said, the company he joins, HubSpot, does seem highly dysfunctional. The behavior Lyons describes seems more like very poor management practices than some unique aspect of modern-day startups. He also is very sarcastic about the DiSC Assessment which I happen to find very useful, even if the underlying science is a bit shaky - that probably biased me against the author ;-)\nTwenty minutes in to the audiobook version of The Hard Thing About Hard Things I had a foreboding that it might be a waste of time - the books starts off with some anecdotes about the author‚Äôs youth that seemed a bit shallow. However, the book does improve greatly and by the end I was glad that I had read it. Although the book does talk about the author‚Äôs experiences in two different startups, it concerns itself mostly with the phase when I started is well-funded has a sizeable number of people working for it and needs to act like a proper company - not the three guys hacking away in a rented apartment that Chaos Monkeys describes. As such it offers a lot of advice for someone transitioning from Founder to CEO. Not sure I‚Äôll ever get to the place where his advice will come in useful, but a worthwhile read nonetheless."
