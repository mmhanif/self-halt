    "text": "Chaos Monkeys: Obscene Fortune and Random Failure in Silicon Valley by Antonio Garcia Martinez\nDisrupted: My Misadventure in the Start-Up Bubble by Dan Lyons\nThe Hard Thing About Hard Things: Building a Business When There Are No Easy Answers by Ben Horowitz\n\nThree books set in startup land, each with a very different perspective on the startup experience. The most enjoyable of the books is Chaos Monkeys. The author, Antonio Garcia Martinez, describes his journey from being a Strat at Goldman Sachs to moving to join an advertising startup in Silicon Valley to founding his own startup to selling the company to Twitter while engineering a job for himself at Facebook to his ultimate ejection from Facebook. He comes across as quite a rascal, super-smart, ascerbic and driven; someone who doesn’t suffer fools gladly and by his account he comes across a lot of fools on his journey.\nFor me the most interesting part of the book was the short period running his own startup - breaking free of the company he was working for, getting accepted into Y-Combinator, dealing with angel investors and VCs, to being acqui-hired by Twitter (with the twist that he himself is acqui-hired by Facebook). I found it fascinating and educational even without all the salacious insider-gossip-type details the author throws in.\nI was less impressed by Disrupted, the story of an old-school writer/editor who gets laid off by Newsweek and decides to venture into startup land, albeit in Boston rather than Silicon Valley. I think I was put off by the snarky, “I’m the only sane person in the building” tone to the book - you could sense an almost continuous rolling of the eyes. There’s definitely another side to this story that I would be interested in hearing about. That being said, the company he joins, HubSpot, does seem highly dysfunctional. The behavior Lyons describes seems more like very poor management practices than some unique aspect of modern-day startups. He also is very sarcastic about the DiSC Assessment which I happen to find very useful, even if the underlying science is a bit shaky - that probably biased me against the author ;-)\nTwenty minutes in to the audiobook version of The Hard Thing About Hard Things I had a foreboding that it might be a waste of time - the books starts off with some anecdotes about the author’s youth that seemed a bit shallow. However, the book does improve greatly and by the end I was glad that I had read it. Although the book does talk about the author’s experiences in two different startups, it concerns itself mostly with the phase when I started is well-funded has a sizeable number of people working for it and needs to act like a proper company - not the three guys hacking away in a rented apartment that Chaos Monkeys describes. As such it offers a lot of advice for someone transitioning from Founder to CEO. Not sure I’ll ever get to the place where his advice will come in useful, but a worthwhile read nonetheless."

Tony Valdez is a Dispatcher - a licensed, bonded professional whose job is to humanely dispatch those whose circumstances put them in death’s crosshairs, so they can have a second chance to avoid the reaper. But when a fellow Dispatcher and former friend is apparently kidnapped, Tony learns that there are some things that are worse than death, and that some people are ready to do almost anything to avenge what they see as a wrong.

Lencioni\n\n\nisbn-13: 9781637743294\nHardcover\nI’m a fan of Lencioni’s books and this one provides useful insights into the sorts of things that might provide different people either joy or frustration at work. I used the model from the book with my team at Meta for our second team “summit” (aka offsite in the world of Finance) and found it very helpful.\nPublisher’s Description: “New York Times best-selling author Patrick Lencioni unveils a truly groundbreaking new model that will change the way we think about work and teams forever. The 6 Types of Working Genius is the fastest way to help people identify the type of work that brings them joy and energy, and avoid work that leads to frustration and burnout. Beyond the personal discovery and instant relief that Working Genius provides, the model also gives teams a remarkably simple and practical framework for tapping into one another’s natural gifts, which increases productivity and reduces unnecessary judgment. In classic Lencioni fashion, Pat brings his model to life in a page-turning fable that is as relatable as it is compelling. He tells the story of Bull Brooks, an entrepreneur, husband, and father who sets out to solve his own frustration at work and stumbles into a new way of thinking that changes the way he sees his work, his team, and even his marriage. What sets this book—and the model behind it—apart from other tools and assessments is the speed at which it can be understood and applied, and the relevance it has to every kind of work in life, from running a company to launching a product to managing a family. In addition to this book, Lencioni and the Table Group have created a 10-minute assessment that helps individuals quickly identify their gifts and apply this model to themselves and their teams. Join the hundreds of thousands of people who have already discovered their Working Genius, and experience the transformation in your work, your team, and your life.

    "text": "Managing Humans: Biting and Humorous Tales of a Software Engineering Manager by Michael Lopp\n\n\nisbn-13: 9781430243144\nAudible\nIf you find the leadership and management book genre to be too earnest then you might enjoy this down-to-earth and sometimes cynical view of business and leadership. I listened to the audiobook of the 3rd edition which was published around 2016 but has it’s roots firmly in the prior decade. As such a lot of the examples and analogies are quite dated, but I found that to be kind of endearing also - an echo of an earlier age when “high-speed internet” meant DSL. Some of the later chapters were hit or miss and the book overall shows its origins in the Rands in Repose blog posts. There was enough value in there for me to buy the paperback 4th edition though.\n\n“A successful organization is built of layers of people that are glued together with managers. Each layer is responsible for a broad task, be it engineering or QA or marketing. Between each layer is a manager whose job it is to translate from one layer to the next… in both directions. He knows what his employees want. He knows what his manager wants, and he’s able to successfully navigate when those wants differ.” Chapter 2 (p17): Managers Are Not Evil\n\n\n“One of your many jobs as a manager is information conduit, and the rules are deceptively simple: for each piece of information you see, you must correctly determine who on your team needs that piece of information to do their job.” Chapter 12 (p75): Information Starvation\n\n\n“I’m not suggesting that you should be worried about your job because some bright human overseas is gunning for you, I’m suggesting that you should be worried about your job because the evolution of how software development occurs might be moving faster than you are. You’ve been working for ten years in your job, five years as a manager, and you’re thinking,”I know how to develop software.” And you do. For now. ….With smaller teams doing more for less, removing yourself from the code strikes me as a bad career move. Even in a monstrous company laden with policy, process, and politics, you can’t forget how to develop software. And how to develop software is changing. Now. Right under your feet, this very second. ….From where you are sitting in your soon-to-be-director chair, do you see software development changing within your company? If the answer is yes, my next question is: How is it changing, and what are you going to do about it? If your answer no, then you need to move your chair because, I swear to you, software development is changing right this second. How in the world are you going to scale if you’re slowly forgetting how software is made?” Chapter 20 (p121): An Engineering Mindset\n\nPublisher’s Description\nThe humor and insights in the 2nd Edition of Managing Humans are drawn from Michael Lopp’s management experiences at Apple, Netscape, Symantec, and Borland, among others. This book is full of stories based on companies in the Silicon Valley where people have been known to yell at each other and occasionally throw chairs. It is a place full of dysfunctional bright people who are in an incredible hurry to find the next big thing so they can strike it rich and then do it all over again. Among these people are managers, a strange breed of people who, through a mystical organizational ritual, have been given power over the future and bank accounts of many others. Whether you’re an aspiring manager, a current manager, or just wondering what the heck a manager does all day, there is a story in this book that will speak to you—and help you survive and prosper amongst the general craziness. Lopp’s straight-from-the-hip style is unlike any other writer on management. He pulls no punches and tells stories he probably shouldn’t. But they are massively instructive and cut to the heart of the matter whether it’s dealing with your boss, handling a slacker, hiring top guns, or seeing a knotty project through to completion. This second editions expands on the management essentials. It will explain why we hate meetings, but must have them, it carefully documents the right way to have a 1-on-1, and it documents the perils of not listening to your team. Writing code is easy. Managing humans is not. You need a book to help you do it, and this is it."

I paid for myself to attend one of their Effective Manager conferences (although I think it was called something different back them) when I worked in Chicago. So when I heard that Mark Horstman was going to release a book, I made sure to order a copy. In fact I got both a signed hardcover as well as the eBook for reference on the go. I even gave a copy to every person on my former management team when I moved roles. I don’t necessarily agree with all their advice - and they are very opinionated - but I appreciate that their advice is detailed and actionable. They’ve really thought through this stuff.\nThough the book is relatively slim - the podcast material collected over 10 years is voluminous and wouldn’t fit in a single volume - this book covers the core Manager Tools guidance. For me the heart of the book is actually in the Afterword, and is probably the core reason why I like these guys so much:\nHighly recommended for any manager or wanna-be manager."

A former rocket scientist reveals the habits, ideas, and strategies that will empower you to turn the seemingly impossible into the possible. Rocket science is often celebrated as the ultimate triumph of technology. But it’s not. Rather, it’s the apex of a certain thought process – a way to imagine the unimaginable and solve the unsolvable. It’s the same thought process that enabled Neil Armstrong to take his giant leap for mankind, that allows spacecraft to travel millions of miles through outer space and land on a precise spot, and that brings us closer to colonizing other planets. Fortunately, you don’t have to be a rocket scientist to think like one. In this accessible and practical book, Ozan Varol reveals nine simple strategies from rocket science that you can use to make your own giant leaps in work and life – whether it’s landing your dream job, accelerating your business, learning a new skill, or creating the next breakthrough product. Today, thinking like a rocket scientist is a necessity. We all encounter complex and unfamiliar problems in our lives. Those who can tackle these problems – without clear guidelines and with the clock ticking – enjoy an extraordinary advantage. Think Like a Rocket Scientist will inspire you to take your own moonshot and enable you to achieve liftoff.”"

The first rocket will take five minutes to hit London. You have six minutes to stop the second. Rudi Graf is an engineer who always dreamed of sending rockets to the moon. But instead, he finds himself working alongside Wernher von Braun, launching V2 rockets at London for the Nazis from a bleak seaside town in occupied Holland. As the SS increases its scrutiny on the project, Graf, an engineer more than a soldier, has to muster all of his willpower to toe the party line. And when rumors of a defector circulate through the German ranks, Graf becomes a prime suspect. Meanwhile, Kay Caton-Walsh, a young English intelligence officer, is living through the turmoil of war. After she and her lover, an RAF officer, are caught in a V2 attack, she volunteers to ship out for newly liberated Belgium. Armed with little more than a slide rule and a few equations, Kay and her colleagues hope to locate and destroy the launch sites. But at this stage in the war it’s hard to know who, if anyone, she can trust. As the death toll soars, these twin stories play out against the background of the German missile campaign during the Second World War. And what the reader comes to understand is that Kay’s and Graf’s destinies are on a collision course."

Fiercely intelligent and in possession of a sharp wit and an even sharper tongue, Rakhi is nobody’s fool, even if she is underestimated by everyone around her. Rakhi’s life isn’t much, but she’s managing. That is, until Rubina Mansoor, a fading former Bollywood starlet, tries to edge her way back into the spotlight by becoming a celebrity ambassador for Justice For All. Steering the organization into uncharted territories, she demands an internship for Alex, a young family friend from Canada and Harvard-bound graduate student. Ambitious, persistent, and naïve, Alex persuades Rakhi to show him “the real” India. In exchange, he’ll do something to further Rakhi’s dreams in a transaction that seems harmless, at first. As old guilt and new aspirations collide, everything Rakhi once knew to be true is set ablaze. And as the stakes mount, she will come face-to-face with the difficult choices and moral compromises that people make in order to survive, no matter the cost. Reema Patel’s transportive debut novel offers a moving, smart, and arrestingly clever look at the cost of ambition and power in reclaiming one’s story."

    "text": "The Trespasser: A Novel by Tana French\n\n\nAlong with Michael Connelly, the other crime fiction writer that I eagerly await each new release from is Tana French. She’s nowhere near as prolific as Connelly - I think this is her sixth novel. Each novel is set in Ireland, most of them cases for the (fictitious) Dublin Murder Squad. Each novel takes a minor character from the previous book and makes him or her the main protagonist in the new book.\nI just love her writing and the edgy, slightly creepy atmosphere she manages to create. Most of her novels so far have had a shadow of the supernatural hanging over them without quite losing touch with reality - just enough to make you wonder if something not quite natural is at play. Her last novel, The Secret Place probably probably had the most overtly supernatural elements, whereas this novel probably has the least. The other element to most of her novels to date is that the protagonist in each somehow comes undone in some way, even as he or she solves the case, some fatal flow in their character causes their victory to turn out hollow in some way. That’s one of the things I’ve really liked in her work. The Trespasser goes easier on the protagonists than her previous work - there’s no personal tragedy awaiting them at the end, which is good and bad. This seems to be her most straight-up detective story of her novels so far. Overall, though, another excellent novel from Tana French - can’t wait for the next one!"

By learning from the best, of course. From creating brand value to fine-tuning customer service, the folks running cartels have been attentive students of the strategy and tactics used by corporations such as Walmart, McDonald’s, and Coca-Cola. And what can government learn to combat this scourge? By analyzing the cartels as companies, law enforcers might better understand how they work—and stop throwing away $100 billion a year in a futile effort to win the “war” against this global, highly organized business. Your intrepid guide to the most exotic and brutal industry on earth is Tom Wainwright. Picking his way through Andean cocaine fields, Central American prisons, Colorado pot shops, and the online drug dens of the Dark Web, Wainwright provides a fresh, innovative look into the drug trade and its 250 million customers. The cast of characters includes “Bin Laden,” the Bolivian coca guide; “Old Lin,” the Salvadoran gang leader; “Starboy,” the millionaire New Zealand pill maker; and a cozy Mexican grandmother who cooks blueberry pancakes while plotting murder. Along with presidents, cops, and teenage hitmen, they explain such matters as the business purpose for head-to-toe tattoos, how gangs decide whether to compete or collude, and why cartels care a surprising amount about corporate social responsibility. More than just an investigation of how drug cartels do business, Narconomics is also a blueprint for how to defeat them."

That’s how I felt: Her book took me to strange depths I never imagined, and I was smitten.” —The New York Times Book Review David Starr Jordan was a taxonomist, a man possessed with bringing order to the natural world. In time, he would be credited with discovering nearly a fifth of the fish known to humans in his day. But the more of the hidden blueprint of life he uncovered, the harder the universe seemed to try to thwart him. His specimen collections were demolished by lightning, by fire, and eventually by the 1906 San Francisco earthquake—which sent more than a thousand discoveries, housed in fragile glass jars, plummeting to the floor. In an instant, his life’s work was shattered. Many might have given up, given in to despair. But Jordan? He surveyed the wreckage at his feet, found the first fish that he recognized, and confidently began to rebuild his collection. And this time, he introduced one clever innovation that he believed would at last protect his work against the chaos of the world. When NPR reporter Lulu Miller first heard this anecdote in passing, she took Jordan for a fool—a cautionary tale in hubris, or denial. But as her own life slowly unraveled, she began to wonder about him. Perhaps instead he was a model for how to go on when all seemed lost. What she would unearth about his life would transform her understanding of history, morality, and the world beneath her feet. Part biography, part memoir, part scientific adventure, Why Fish Don’t Exist is a wondrous fable about how to persevere in a world where chaos will always prevail."

It’s not a life-changing book but interesting and full of good advice.\nLeonard defines mastery as “the mysterious process during which what is at first difficult becomes progressively easier and more pleasurable through practice”. There is a mastery curve which has relatively brief spurts of progress, each of which is followed by a slight decline to a plateau somewhat higher than that which preceded it.

After you’ve read a few of her books you’ll know that her protagonists are always changed in some fundamental way by the end, broken along some dimension of their being. You don’t want to be a primary character in one of her novels. The Witch Elm is somewhat different than her previous Dublin Murder Squad novels in that the narrative isnt described through the eyes of the police investigating the crime but instead through the eyes of the victim. It’s still great and her writing is (as always) breathtaking at times. Unlike, say, Michael Connelly or JK Rowling, she isnt primarily a storyteller but someone who creates scenes and tensions that envelope you. Although this has gotten some negative reviews relative to her earlier novels, I was not disappointed in the least."

Fear provides an excuse to avoid responsibility. Even before the ex-virus, there were many people throughout history who took advantage of this tendency.”"

This work is a quintessential example of Wilde’s celebrated wit and satirical style, blending elements of mystery, social comedy, and Gothic fiction. Wilde subverts traditional Victorian moral values by presenting murder not as a heinous sin or a source of guilt, but as a tiresome social obligation that must be discharged to maintain propriety. The narrative treats the act of killing with a paradoxical banality, focusing on the protagonist’s anxiety over the timing and method rather than the morality of the deed itself [2]."

    "text": "Overview of the story\nThe narrative begins at a reception hosted by Lady Windermere, where she introduces her guests to Mr. Septimus R. Podgers, a “cheiromantist” or palm reader. Podgers impresses the guests with his insights, but when he examines the hand of young Lord Arthur Savile, he becomes visibly distressed. Privately, Lord Arthur bribes Podgers to reveal the truth, and the palm reader reluctantly predicts that Arthur is destined to commit a murder [1].\nTerrified by this prophecy, Lord Arthur wanders the streets of London. His fear, however, is not rooted in the immorality of taking a life, but in the potential social disgrace and the burden of having such a duty hanging over him. He is engaged to the innocent Sybil Merton and decides he cannot marry her until he has fulfilled this destiny, reasoning that it would be dishonorable to burden his future wife with the shadow of a future crime. He resolves to commit the murder immediately to clear the way for his marriage [1].\nHis first target is a distant relative, Lady Clementina Beauchamp. He gifts her a poisoned pill, ostensibly as a cure for heartburn, and departs for Venice believing the deed is done. Upon his return, he learns of her death and feels relief, only to later discover the pill untouched among her effects, revealing she died of natural causes. Distraught that he is “not yet a murderer,” Arthur attempts a second murder, targeting his uncle, the Dean of Chichester. He sends an anonymous explosive clock to the Deanery, but the bomb fails to detonate properly and merely becomes a novelty toy for the Dean’s children [1].\nPlunged into despair and believing he has failed his duty, Lord Arthur wanders by the Thames at night. By chance, he spots Mr. Podgers leaning over the embankment. In a sudden moment of inspiration, he pushes the cheiromantist into the river, where he drowns. The death is ruled accidental, and Lord Arthur, having finally fulfilled the prophecy, feels a profound sense of relief and accomplishment. He marries Sybil, and the story concludes with them living a happy life, with Arthur secretly attributing his domestic bliss to the successful completion of his “duty” [1]."

    "text": "Overview of the characters\nLord Arthur Savile serves as the protagonist and a satirical subversion of the traditional hero. He is wealthy, well-meaning, and deeply committed to what he perceives as his duty. However, his sense of duty is entirely divorced from universal morality. He views the murder he must commit as an administrative task—a “check” to be cashed—rather than a moral atrocity. His character critiques the superficiality of an upper class that prioritizes form and social obligation over genuine ethics [2].\nMr. Septimus R. Podgers is the cheiromantist who sets the plot in motion. Described as physically unappealing, he holds sway over the superstitious upper class. He represents the charlatanism that often fascinated Victorian society. His death at the hands of Lord Arthur is the story’s ultimate irony: by predicting the murder, he unwittingly identifies himself as the victim [1].\nLady Windermere is a prominent society hostess who treats people and their talents as mere amusements. She flits from one fad to another, representing the frivolous and transient nature of high society interests.\nSybil Merton is Lord Arthur’s fiancée, representing idealized, passive innocence. She is the unaware motivation for Arthur’s actions; his twisted logic dictates that he must become a murderer to protect her purity [2]."

    "section": "Overview of the themes",
    "text": "Overview of the themes\nDuty vs. Morality is the central theme of the story. Wilde inverts the Victorian obsession with duty by applying it to a criminal act. Lord Arthur suffers no pangs of conscience regarding the act of murder itself; his anxiety is entirely focused on the social inconvenience of the prophecy. The subtitle, “A Study of Duty,” highlights this satire, presenting a protagonist whose conscience is perfectly clear provided he adheres to his own warped code of conduct [2].\nFate vs. Free Will is explored through the concept of the self-fulfilling prophecy. Lord Arthur believes he is a victim of an inescapable fate, yet he uses his free will to actively engineer that fate. Paradoxically, by trying to control his destiny and “get it over with,” he enslaves himself to the prediction made by Podgers [2].\nThe Satire of Social Class permeates the narrative. Wilde mocks the aristocracy for their trivial concerns and moral vacuity. In this world, murder is treated with the same casual annoyance as a breach of etiquette. The characters are obsessed with the appearance of propriety, rendering them blind to the absurdity of their actions [3]."

While contemporary reception was mixed, with some critics finding the story simplistic compared to his dramatic works, modern criticism acknowledges it as a masterful synthesis of social satire and Gothic conventions [3]. The story remains a celebrated example of Wilde’s ability to expose the absurdities of social convention through paradox, humor, and the inversion of moral norms."

    "section": "",
    "text": "How We Change by Ross Ellenhorn\n\n\nisbn-13: 9780062961112\nAudible\n\nPersonal change is always a courageous act.\n\nThis is ‘change’ from the viewpoint of a psychotherapist and should probably be more accurately titled “why we don’t change”. It focuses mostly on changing negative or toxic behaviors rather changing our thoughts and beliefs.\nEllenhorn claims we are wired to double down on the familiar because of what he calls the “Fear of Hope” - the act of protecting ourselves from further disappointment.\nHe identifies the “10 Reasons Not to Change” to help us see why we behave the way we do when we are faced with the “challenge of hope”:\n\nRaising one’s own expectations about change: When we change something for the better, we always risk disappointing ourselves if we can’t maintain the change.\nRaising the expectations of others: By making a positive change in one’s life, a person not only raises his own expectations; he inevitably raises the expectations of others. Doing so, he risks that others will witness his failure to maintain the new, more positive status he has achieved.\nFacing where you are in life: Progressive change requires that individuals assess what they need to change, and thus confront the current state of the lives they have authored.\nTaking “small steps”: To change his circumstances, a person is not merely required to face where he is in that moment, but to do so repetitively, as he takes the incremental steps towards a goal. Each step is a reminder of where he is and how far he has to go to reach his goals.\nBeing accountable for “what’s next”: Each change a person makes testifies that she is accountable for the life that lies ahead. The more she changes, the more the outcome of her life is seen as within her power.\nFacing the unknown: By enacting change in one’s life, a person faces the unknown possibilities of a life that is in his hands. When we enact change, we must contend not only with an unpredictable world, but also with the unpredictability of the future created in part by our own actions.\nExistential aloneness: Change always makes us face our own aloneness. Enacting change, a person recognizes that she alone is the author of her life, the originator of things she has made happen in the past, what she is making happen now, and what she will make happen in the future.\nLosing a social support: When a person makes positive changes in her treatment, she inevitably steps on a path that leads out of treatment, and thus away from prior therapeutic relationships.\nDestroying the negatives: Keeping his behavior the same is his only means of protecting an enduring memorial to the past. Changing this behavior is like demolishing his memorial.\nConditional aloneness in the presence of others: Therapists and therapeutic communities offer enduring recognition to those they treat, providing their clients the important sense that they exist in the mind’s eyes of someone else even when they are out of physical sight. And they often provide this continuous attention without the pressures of expectations regarding accountability.\n\nPublisher’s Description: “A paradigm-shifting, instant classic in the making that challenges our assumptions about change by encouraging us to understand and embrace our resistance to it. We all have something we want to change about ourselves. But whether it’s quitting smoking, losing weight, or breaking some common bad habit or negative behavior pattern, we feel a sense of failure when we don’t succeed. This often sets off a cascade of negative feelings and discouragement, making it even harder to change. The voice in our head tells us: Why bother? Successful change depends far more on understanding why we don’t change, psychotherapist and sociologist Ross Ellenhorn insists. His decades-long career as a pioneer in helping people overcome extreme psychiatric experiences and problematic substance use issues– especially those whom the behavioral healthcare system has failed– especially those whom the mental healthcare system has failed–has lead him to develop an effective, long-term method to achieve transformation, from the simplest shifts to the most profound. In How We Change, Ellenhorn looks to the evolutionary imperatives driving us. We are wired to double down on the familiar because of what he calls the Fear of Hope–the act of protecting ourselves from further disappointment. He identifies the”10 Reasons Not to Change” to help us see why we behave the way we do, making it clear that there is nothing broken inside us–it’s how we’re built. By addressing this little known reality, he gives us hope and helps us work toward the change we seek. Ellenhorn speaks to the core of our insecurities and fears about ourselves, with a humor and kindness. By turning our judgements about self-destructive behaviors into curious questions about them, he teaches us to think about our actions to discover what we truly want–even if we’re going about getting it in the wrong way. How We Change is a brilliant approach that will forever alter our perspective–and help us achieve the transformation we truly seek.”"

    "text": "The Oligarch’s Daughter by Joseph Finder\n\n\nisbn-13: 9780063396029\nAudible\n\nAI Generated Content\n\n\nGenerated by gemini-3-pro-preview\n\n\n\nImage generated by gemini-3-pro-image-preview in the style of XKCD - with apologies to Randall Munroe\n\n\nThe Oligarch’s Daughter, the fifth installment in the Nick Heller series by Joseph Finder, marks the return of the Boston-based “private spy.” Published by HarperCollins, the novel shifts focus from the corporate espionage typical of previous entries toward geopolitical intrigue, centering on the collision between American private interests and Russian organized crime.\nStory Arc and Plot Summary\nThe narrative begins with a high-stakes extraction. Nick Heller is hired to protect Paulina Ivanova, a young woman living in the United States who finds herself the target of lethal professionals following the suspicious death of her father. Her father, a prominent Russian oligarch formerly aligned with the Kremlin, recently died under mysterious circumstances—falling from a window in Moscow—leaving Paulina as the sole possessor of a dangerous secret.\nUnlike a standard kidnapping case, the situation is complicated by what Paulina carries. She holds an encrypted digital ledger, a “black box” of financial secrets and kompromat (compromising material) that outlines the illicit wealth and leverage her father hoarded. This information makes her a target not only of rival oligarchs looking to seize the assets but also of Russian intelligence operatives intent on burying the secrets permanently.\nThe story unfolds as a breathless chase across New England and the Mid-Atlantic. Heller must utilize his specialized skill set—ranging from physical combat to high-tech surveillance and social engineering—to keep Paulina off the grid. The narrative arc moves from a defensive posture, where Heller and Paulina are constantly reacting to ambushes, to an offensive strategy. Realizing they cannot run indefinitely, Heller orchestrates a complex counter-operation designed to turn the hunters into the hunted, leveraging the very information the antagonists seek to destroy them. The climax involves a tense confrontation where financial leverage proves as deadly as ballistics.\nCharacter Development\nNick Heller Heller remains the anchor of the series, characterized by his background in Special Forces and his cynical yet rigid moral code. In this installment, Finder emphasizes Heller’s resourcefulness over brute strength. He is depicted not as a superhero, but as a pragmatic operator who relies on preparation and intelligence. The novel explores his weariness with the corruption he encounters, yet reinforces his compulsion to aid those who cannot help themselves. His relationship with Paulina challenges his professional detachment, forcing him to navigate the line between asset protection and personal empathy.\nPaulina Ivanova Paulina serves as the catalyst for the plot but is developed beyond a mere MacGuffin. Initially presented as a terrified victim of circumstance, she reveals layers of competence and resilience. Having grown up adjacent to ruthless power, she possesses an intuitive understanding of the enemy’s mindset. Her development centers on her transition from a passive figure fleeing her father’s legacy to an active participant in dismantling the forces threatening her.\nThe Antagonists The opposition is represented by a mix of efficient Russian operatives and American enablers. Rather than cartoonish villains, Finder portrays them as corporate professionals of violence—bureaucratic, methodical, and financially motivated. This grounding keeps the threat level realistic and consistent with the book’s tone.\nThemes and Messages\nThe Long Arm of the Oligarchy The primary theme is the permeability of national borders when it comes to illicit finance and power. Finder illustrates how Russian volatility can bleed into American life, suggesting that in a globalized economy, no one is truly isolated from foreign corruption. The novel examines how “dirty money” is laundered through legitimate Western institutions, implicating the systems that allow oligarchs to operate globally.\nSurveillance and Privacy Consistent with the series’ focus, the book explores the erosion of privacy. Heller’s tradecraft highlights how easily individuals can be tracked through digital footprints, facial recognition, and data mining. The narrative suggests that in the modern era, anonymity is the ultimate luxury—and the hardest to maintain.\nLegacy and Sins of the Father The title refers not just to Paulina’s identity, but to the burden of inheritance. The story questions whether a child can escape the moral debts of a parent. Paulina’s struggle is not just for physical survival, but for the freedom to define herself outside the shadow of her father’s corruption.\nStyle and Tone\nFinder employs a lean, journalistic prose style. The pacing is rapid, utilizing short chapters and alternating perspectives to maintain tension. The tone is objective and grounded in tradecraft realism; the author prioritizes the mechanics of espionage—how to sweep a room for bugs, how to execute a counter-surveillance route—over melodramatic action sequences. The dialogue is functional and sharp, often serving to advance the plot or reveal tactical information.\nThe Oligarch’s Daughter functions as a procedural thriller that merges the specific mechanics of private intelligence with the broader anxieties of modern geopolitical conflict."

Young, the book defines “ultralearning” as a strategy for acquiring skills and knowledge that is both self-directed and intense [1]. It is designed for aggressive career advancers, polymaths, and anyone dissatisfied with the slow pace of traditional education who wants to “future-proof” their career in a rapidly changing economy. Young draws upon his own experiences, such as the “MIT Challenge” where he learned the 4-year MIT Computer Science curriculum in 12 months, and the “Year Without English,” as well as case studies of other successful ultralearners [2]."

    "section": "Overview of the Key Points",
    "text": "Overview of the Key Points\nThe core of the book revolves around nine distinct principles that can be applied to master any subject effectively [1]:\n\n1. Metalearning (First Draw a Map)\nBefore diving into the material, successful ultralearners study how to learn the subject. This involves creating a roadmap by identifying the concepts to understand, facts to memorize, and procedures to practice. Young suggests spending approximately 10% of total learning time on this planning phase to ensure efficiency.\n\n\n2. Focus (Sharpen Your Knife)\nDeep concentration is essential for ultralearning. This principle involves managing three common obstacles: procrastination (failing to start), distraction (drifting off), and a lack of mental stamina. Cultivating the ability to focus deeply allows for longer, more productive learning sessions.\n\n\n3. Directness (Go Straight Ahead)\nOne should learn by doing the thing they want to get good at. This avoids the “transfer” problem often seen in traditional education, where classroom learning fails to translate to real-world application. For example, if the goal is to learn a language, one should speak it; if the goal is to code, one should write software.\n\n\n4. Drill (Attack Your Weakest Point)\nComplex skills should be broken down into their component parts, allowing the learner to ruthlessly practice their weakest links. By isolating and improving specific bottlenecks, the overall skill improves much faster than through holistic practice alone.\n\n\n5. Retrieval (Test to Learn)\nInstead of passively reviewing notes, learners should force themselves to recall information without aid. Self-testing is presented as one of the most effective study methods, relying on the concept of “desirable difficulty”—the harder it is to recall information, the better it is learned.\n\n\n6. Feedback (Don’t Dodge the Punches)\nUltralearners actively seek harsh, immediate feedback. Young categorizes feedback into three types: Outcome (pass/fail), Informational (what was done wrong), and Corrective (how to fix it). Seeking out informational and corrective feedback is crucial for rapid improvement.\n\n\n7. Retention (Don’t Fill a Leaky Bucket)\nUnderstanding why humans forget—due to decay or interference—is key to preventing it. Strategies to improve retention include Spaced Repetition Systems (SRS) and overlearning, which involves practicing beyond the point of initial mastery.\n\n\n8. Intuition (Dig Deep Before Building Up)\nLearners should aim for a deep conceptual understanding rather than just memorizing formulas or facts. The “Feynman Technique,” which involves explaining a complex concept in simple terms, is a primary method for identifying gaps in understanding and building intuition.\n\n\n9. Experimentation (Explore Outside Your Comfort Zone)\nWhile beginners follow established paths, mastery requires experimentation. Learners must eventually test different methods, resources, and styles to discover what works best for their unique cognitive profile and specific goals."

    "text": "Overview of the Key Themes\nThe book explores several underlying themes that challenge traditional views on education and skill acquisition.\n\nActive vs. Passive Learning\nA recurring theme is the rejection of passive learning methods such as reading, highlighting, or listening to lectures. Instead, the book advocates for active engagement through drilling, testing, and doing. This shift transforms learning from a consumption activity into a production activity.\n\n\nIntensity and Immersion\nYoung argues that learning is often most efficient when compressed into short, intense bursts rather than spread out thinly over long periods. This intensity helps maintain focus and momentum, preventing the knowledge decay that occurs with infrequent practice.\n\n\nSelf-Directedness\nTraditional schooling often fosters dependency on teachers and curriculums. Ultralearning demands that the learner take full responsibility for their own curriculum, schedule, and standards of success. It empowers individuals to be the architects of their own education [2]."

It challenges the notion that one must wait for a university or institution to provide education. Instead, by applying the nine principles of ultralearning, individuals can build their own curriculums and master any skill through aggressive, self-directed practice. While the method requires significant time and intensity, it offers a practical path for those willing to do the work to achieve mastery without formal instruction."

Now Peter’s job is monitoring an emergency line for a call that has not–and might never–come. Until tonight. At 1:05 A.M. the phone rings. A terrified young woman named Rose tells Peter that two people have just been murdered and that the killer might still be in the house with her. One of the victims gave her this phone number with urgent instructions: “Tell them OSPREY was right.

I feel understand the role of central banks much better after reading this.\nPublisher’s Description: “THIS HAS HAPPENED BEFORE. The current financial crisis has only one parallel: the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and subsequent Great Depression of the 1930s, which crippled the future of an entire generation and set the stage for the horrors of the Second World War. Yet the economic meltdown could have been avoided, had it not been for the decisions taken by a small number of central bankers. In Lords of Finance, we meet these men, the four bankers who truly broke the world: the enigmatic Norman Montagu of the bank of England, Benjamin Strong of the NY Federal Reserve, the arrogant yet brilliant Hjalmar Schacht of the Reichsbanlk and the xenophobic Emile Moreau of the Banque de France. Their names were lost to history, their lives and actions forgotten, until now. Liaquat Ahamed tells their story in vivid and gripping detail, in a timely and arresting reminder that individuals - their ambitions, limitations and human nature - lie at the very heart of global catastrophe.”"

Christened a potential savior of Silicon Valley’s startup culture, Adam Neumann was set to take WeWork, his office share company disrupting the commercial real estate market, public, cash out on the company’s 47 billion dollar valuation, and break the string of major startups unable to deliver to shareholders. But as employees knew, and investors soon found out, WeWork’s capital was built on promises that the company was more than a real estate purveyor, that in fact it was a transformational technology company. Veteran journalist Reeves Weideman dives deep into WeWork and it CEO’s astronomical rise, from the marijuana and tequila-filled board rooms to cult-like company summer camps and consciousness-raising with Anthony Kiedis. Billion Dollar Loser is a character-driven business narrative that captures, through the fascinating psyche of a billionaire founder and his wife and co-founder, the slippery state of global capitalism.”"

The authors argue that while our existence is a continuous stream of time, our memory does not record it that way. Instead, we remember our lives as a series of “defining moments”—short, distinct experiences that stand out from the everyday. These defining moments are often characterized by transitions, milestones, peaks, or pits [1].\nThe central premise of the book is that we do not need to wait for these moments to happen by chance. By understanding the elements that make an experience memorable, individuals—whether they are parents, teachers, managers, or service providers—can actively become “architects” of their own lives and the lives of others. The book provides a practical framework for turning ordinary occurrences into extraordinary events that elevate, inspire, and connect us [1][2]."

A powerful moment does not need to possess all four, but it usually contains at least one of these ingredients [1].\n\nElevation\nMoments of elevation are experiences that rise above the routine. They provoke distinct delight and engagement. To build elevation, one must: * Boost Sensory Appeal: “Turn up the volume” on reality by making things look, taste, or feel better than usual. * Raise the Stakes: Introduce an element of productive pressure, such as a competition or a public performance. * Break the Script: Strategically violate expectations. By disrupting the routine with a surprise, one can capture attention and create a lasting memory [2].\n\n\nInsight\nMoments of insight rewire our understanding of ourselves or the world. These realizations can influence behavior for years. Strategies include: * Tripping Over the Truth: Instead of simply stating a problem, create a scenario where people discover the truth for themselves. This visceral realization is more powerful than a lecture. * Stretching for Insight: Mentors and leaders can help others generate insight by pushing them to “stretch”—placing them in situations where they risk failure but have the support to learn and grow [2].\n\n\nPride\nMoments of pride capture us at our best, celebrating achievement and courage. * Recognize Others: Effective recognition must be personal rather than programmatic. Validating an individual’s specific contribution is far more impactful than a generic “employee of the month” award. * Multiply Milestones: Long journeys should be broken down into intermediate finish lines. This creates more opportunities for celebration and a sense of progress (e.g., the “Couch to 5k” model). * Practice Courage: Courage is often a result of preparation. By “preloading” a response to a difficult situation, individuals are more likely to act bravely when the moment arrives [2].\n\n\nConnection\nMoments of connection strengthen the bonds between people. * Create Shared Meaning: For groups, this involves synchronizing moments or facing a shared struggle, which builds solidarity. * Deepen Ties: For individuals, connection is fostered through responsiveness—demonstrating that one understands, validates, and cares for the other person [2]."

    "text": "Overview of the Key Themes\n\nThe Architect vs. The Spectator\nA recurring theme in the book is the concept of agency. Too often, people drift through life as spectators, waiting for special occasions to occur naturally. The authors challenge this passivity, asserting that anyone can be an architect of moments. By recognizing the structure of a defining moment, we can manufacture them to improve customer service, employee engagement, and personal relationships [1].\n\n\nThe Peak-End Rule and Duration Neglect\nThe authors lean on psychological research, specifically the work of Daniel Kahneman, to explain “duration neglect.” We tend to forget how long an experience lasted and instead judge it by its “peak” (the most intense moment, positive or negative) and its “end.” This theme suggests that to improve an experience, one does not need to fix every minor detail but rather focus on creating a few high peaks and a strong finish [1].\n\n\nTransitions and Milestones\nLife is naturally punctuated by transitions (graduations, new jobs, moving houses). The authors emphasize that these transitions are natural opportunities for defining moments. However, many transitions are missed opportunities—such as a lackluster first day at a new job. The book argues for spotting these natural transition points and investing effort to mark them significantly."

Chip and Dan Heath demonstrate that extraordinary experiences are not merely accidents of fate but are constructed from specific, replicable elements. By mastering the elements of Elevation, Insight, Pride, and Connection, we can create memories that endure, spark change, and bring us closer together. The book ultimately invites readers to pay attention to the moments that matter and to take responsibility for creating more of them."

Rowling), released in September 2025 [1]. The novel continues the professional and personal journeys of private detectives Cormoran Strike and Robin Ellacott as they tackle a grotesque mystery involving the antique silver trade, while navigating their own increasingly complex personal lives. Set against the backdrops of London’s Holborn district and the atmospheric Channel Island of Sark, the book delves into themes of identity, paternity, and the reliability of official narratives."

He is approached by a frantic new client, Decima Mullins, who disputes the official police identification of a body found in the vault of Ramsay Silver, a high-end silver shop [2]. The police have identified the victim as Jason Knowles, a convicted armed robber, but Decima is convinced the body belongs to her missing boyfriend, Rupert Fleetwood, who vanished around the same time [2].\nThe case is marked by its gruesome nature; the victim was found decapitated and mutilated to hinder identification, with a curious “hallmark” carved into the back [2]. Decima’s desperation is fueled by her need to prove to her son, Lion, that his father did not abandon them. As Strike and Robin investigate, they uncover a web of deceit connecting the antique silver world, Freemasonry, and the criminal underbelly [2]. The trail leads them to the island of Sark, where the isolation and rugged terrain mirror the danger they face."

His feelings for Robin remain a central tension, complicated by the events of the previous book and his own emotional guardedness.\nRobin Ellacott Robin faces a profound personal crisis in this installment. Early in the narrative, she suffers a ruptured ectopic pregnancy, a traumatic event that requires emergency surgery and leaves lasting physical and emotional scars [2]. This tragedy forces her to confront her relationship with her boyfriend, Ryan Murphy, who is portrayed as increasingly manipulative and unsympathetic to her trauma, using his police connections to maintain control [2].\nSupporting Characters\n\nDecima Mullins: The client, whose instability and desperation drive the plot. She is the sister of Valentine Longcaster.\nRupert Fleetwood: The missing man at the center of the mystery, a former gambling club employee.\nRyan Murphy: Robin’s boyfriend, whose behavior takes a darker turn as he exploits Robin’s vulnerabilities.\nValentine Longcaster: A depraved figure from Charlotte Campbell’s circle who becomes a person of interest [2]."

The novel examines what is passed down from one generation to the next, whether it be trauma, names, or material inheritance.\nGrief and Trauma The book is heavily laden with grief. Both protagonists are navigating significant losses—Strike’s bereavement and Robin’s physical and emotional trauma [2].

It is said that the greatest chess masters can envision a match’s outcome ten moves before it occurs. Imagine a person who can visualize ten steps ahead, not simply in the game of chess, but in every human interaction. Imagine a person who can see a punch before it is thrown; who knows what you are going to say before you say it; who can see every political and economic move long before it happens. Imagine a secret that can make this all possible. Mathematics professor Albert Puddles exposes this secret for himself as he is thrust into a murder investigation on the Princeton campus. The discovery leads Albert to delve into ancient religious interpretation and unmask new analytical abilities, all while teaming up with an aging mentor, a curious teaching assistant, and an elite Book Club on a frantic chase across America to recover this world-changing knowledge before it falls into dangerous hands. Albert-now embedded in a national cat-and-mouse political power play- rediscovers a woman from his past and is forced to confront his own understanding of love, rationality, power, and the true limits of the human mind.”"

From the New York Times bestselling author of Chasing the Scream and Lost Connections comes a groundbreaking examination of why this is happening—and how to get our attention back. “The book the world needs in order to win the war on distraction.”—Adam Grant, author of Think Again “Read this book to save your mind.”—Susan Cain, author of Quiet ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR: The Wall Street Journal In the United States, teenagers can focus on one task for only sixty-five seconds at a time, and office workers average only three minutes. Like so many of us, Johann Hari was finding that constantly switching from device to device and tab to tab was a diminishing and depressing way to live. He tried all sorts of self-help solutions—even abandoning his phone for three months—but nothing seemed to work. So Hari went on an epic journey across the world to interview the leading experts on human attention—and he discovered that everything we think we know about this crisis is wrong. We think our inability to focus is a personal failure to exert enough willpower over our devices. The truth is even more disturbing: our focus has been stolen by powerful external forces that have left us uniquely vulnerable to corporations determined to raid our attention for profit. Hari found that there are twelve deep causes of this crisis, from the decline of mind-wandering to rising pollution, all of which have robbed some of our attention. In Stolen Focus, he introduces readers to Silicon Valley dissidents who learned to hack human attention, and veterinarians who diagnose dogs with ADHD. He explores a favela in Rio de Janeiro where everyone lost their attention in a particularly surreal way, and an office in New Zealand that discovered a remarkable technique to restore workers’ productivity. Crucially, Hari learned how we can reclaim our focus—as individuals, and as a society—if we are determined to fight for it. Stolen Focus will transform the debate about attention and finally show us how to get it back."

    "section": "Summary of Key Points**",
    "text": "Summary of Key Points**\n\nThe Problem of Annualized Thinking\nThe authors argue that the primary obstacle to high performance is “annualized thinking”—the mindset that there are 365 days in a year to achieve goals. This long timeline leads to complacency early in the year and a frantic push for results in November and December. By the time urgency kicks in, it is often too late to recover lost opportunities.\n\n“We mistakenly believe that there is a lot of time left in the year, and we act accordingly. We lack a sense of urgency, not realizing that every week is important, every day is important, every moment is important.” (p. 16)\n\n\n\nThe 12 Week Year Concept\nThe core methodology involves redefining a “year” as a 12-week period. In this system, there are no annual plans, only 12-week plans. This timeframe is long enough to get significant work done but short enough to maintain a constant sense of urgency. At the end of 12 weeks, there is a review period (the “year-end”), followed by a fresh start. This structure aims to replicate the “December push” continuously throughout the calendar year.\n\n\nExecution over Knowledge\nMoran and Lennington posit that most individuals and organizations already possess the knowledge required to succeed; the gap exists in execution. Success is determined not by what one knows, but by the consistent application of that knowledge.\n\n“Execution is the single greatest market differentiator.” (p. 11)\n\n\n\nThe Three Principles of High Performance\n\nAccountability: Defined not as consequences, but as ownership. It is the character trait of willingness to own one’s actions and results, regardless of circumstances.\nCommitment: Keeping promises made to oneself. The book distinguishes commitment from merely “trying” or “hoping.”\nGreatness in the Moment: The understanding that results are the lagging indicator of past actions. Success is created in the moment of decision when one chooses to do the necessary (often difficult) work.\n\n\n\nVision Connection\nEffective planning begins with a vision that extends beyond business goals. The authors emphasize a three-tiered vision structure:\n\nLong-term Aspirational Vision: What one wants for their life eventually.\n3-Year Vision: A clearer picture of the medium-term future.\n12-Week Goals: Specific, measurable targets that align with the larger vision.\n\n\n“A compelling vision creates a strong emotional connection to the work you are doing today.” (p. 45)\n\n\n\nWriting the 12 Week Plan\nA 12-week plan should be limited to two or three primary goals to ensure focus. Each goal must have specific “tactics”—the daily and weekly actions required to achieve the goal. The plan focuses on leading indicators (actions taken) rather than lagging indicators (results achieved).\n\n\nProcess Control: The Weekly Routine\nTo manage the 12-week cycle, the authors prescribe a weekly routine:\n\nScore Your Week: Measure execution of the previous week’s tactics.\nPlan Your Week: Map out the tactics for the upcoming week.\nParticipate in a WAM (Weekly Accountability Meeting): A short meeting (15–30 minutes) with peers to report on execution scores and commit to the next week’s actions.\n\n\n\nScorekeeping\nThe system relies on a weekly execution score. If a user plans 10 tactics and completes 8, their score is 80%. The authors state that consistently achieving an execution score of 85% or higher generally guarantees the achievement of the 12-week goals. This shifts the focus from worrying about the outcome to focusing on the process.\n\n“If you successfully complete 85 percent of the tactics in your plan, you will most likely achieve your objectives.”* (p. 96)\n\n\n\nThe Emotional Cycle of Change\nThe book prepares readers for the psychological stages of adopting a new system:\n\nUninformed Optimism: Excitement at the start.\nInformed Pessimism: The realization of the effort required.\nThe Valley of Despair: Where most people quit due to pain and lack of immediate results.\nInformed Optimism: Results begin to appear.\nSuccess and Fulfillment: The new behaviors become habitual.\n\n\n\nIntentional Time Use\nTo execute the plan, time must be blocked specifically. The authors categorize time into three distinct blocks:\n\nStrategic Blocks: Three hours of uninterrupted time scheduled weekly to work on the high-value activities (tactics) in the plan.\nBuffer Blocks: Time scheduled to deal with low-value, unplanned activities like email and phone calls (usually 30–60 minutes per day).\nBreakout Blocks: Three hours of free time scheduled during work hours to refresh the mind and prevent burnout.\n\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\nThe 4 Disciplines of Execution: Achieving Your Wildly Important Goals by Chris McChesney, Sean Covey, and Jim Huling\nGetting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity by David Allen\nAtomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones by James Clear\nEssentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less by Greg McKeown"

    "text": "Marcus Aurelius: The Stoic Emperor by Donald J. Robertson\n\n\nisbn-13: 9781503280465\nAudible\nGood insights into the life of Marcus Aurelius, the historical context he lived in and the philosophies that inspired him. The author is clearly a fan of Marcus Aurelius - although he does talk about some of the controversies around the emperor - for example, the allegation that he persecuted Christians or at least turned a blind eye to the persecution. I’ve always wondered how a person of such integrity and probity as Marcus Aurelius could have handed his legacy to such a degenerate as his son Commodus. Robertson doesn’t address this in the detail I would hope other than to assert that Commodus fell in with some bad influences.\nPublisher’s Description\nThis novel biography brings Marcus Aurelius (121-180 CE) to life for a new generation by exploring the emperor’s fascinating psychological journey. Donald J. Robertson examines Marcus’s relationships with key figures in his life, such as his mother, Domitia Lucilla, and the emperor Hadrian, as well as his Stoic tutors. He draws extensively on Marcus’s own Meditations and correspondence, and he examines the emperor’s actions as detailed in the Augustan History and other ancient texts.\nMarcus Aurelius struggled to reconcile his philosophy and moral values with the political pressures he faced as emperor at the height of Roman power. Robertson examines Marcus’s attitude toward slavery and the moral dilemma posed by capturing enemies in warfare; his attitude toward women; the role of Stoicism in shaping his response to the threat of civil war; the treatment of Christians under his rule; and the naming of his notorious son Commodus as his successor.\nThroughout, the Meditations is used to shed light on the mind of the emperor—his character, values, and motives—as Robertson skillfully weaves together Marcus’s inner journey as a philosopher with the outer events of his life as a Roman emperor."

Named a Most Anticipated book of 2024 by TIME ∙ The New York Times ∙ Goodreads ∙ Entertainment Weekly ∙ Today ∙ Paste ∙ SheReads ∙ BookPage ∙ Woman’s World ∙ The Nerd Daily and more! A shimmering, joyful new novel about a pair of opposites with the wrong thing in common, from #1 New York Times bestselling author Emily Henry. Daphne always loved the way her fiancé Peter told their story. How they met (on a blustery day), fell in love (over an errant hat), and moved back to his lakeside hometown to begin their life together. He really was good at telling it…right up until the moment he realized he was actually in love with his childhood best friend Petra. Which is how Daphne begins her new story: Stranded in beautiful Waning Bay, Michigan, without friends or family but with a dream job as a children’s librarian (that barely pays the bills), and proposing to be roommates with the only person who could possibly understand her predicament: Petra’s ex, Miles Nowak. Scruffy and chaotic—with a penchant for taking solace in the sounds of heart break love ballads—Miles is exactly the opposite of practical, buttoned up Daphne, whose coworkers know so little about her they have a running bet that she’s either FBI or in witness protection. The roommates mainly avoid one another, until one day, while drowning their sorrows, they form a tenuous friendship and a plan. If said plan also involves posting deliberately misleading photos of their summer adventures together, well, who could blame them? But it’s all just for show, of course, because there’s no way Daphne would actually start her new chapter by falling in love with her ex- fiancé’s new fiancée’s ex…right?"

Trevor Noah is a huge success today, but he’s had a remarkable and difficult early life. Along with being his personal story, this is also a story of South Africa during and after the overturning of Apartheid. Noah lets the reader see what it was like growing up poor and black in South Africa but always showing the humanity of the people he came into contact with.\nPublisher’s Description: “#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • More than one million copies sold! A “brilliant” (Lupita Nyong’o, Time), “poignant” (Entertainment Weekly), “soul-nourishing” (USA Today) memoir about coming of age during the twilight of apartheid “Noah’s childhood stories are told with all the hilarity and intellect that characterizes his comedy, while illuminating a dark and brutal period in South Africa’s history that must never be forgotten.”—Esquire Winner of the Thurber Prize for American Humor and an NAACP Image Award • Named one of the best books of the year by The New York Time, USA Today, San Francisco Chronicle, NPR, Esquire, Newsday, and Booklist Trevor Noah’s unlikely path from apartheid South Africa to the desk of The Daily Show began with a criminal act: his birth. Trevor was born to a white Swiss father and a black Xhosa mother at a time when such a union was punishable by five years in prison. Living proof of his parents’ indiscretion, Trevor was kept mostly indoors for the earliest years of his life, bound by the extreme and often absurd measures his mother took to hide him from a government that could, at any moment, steal him away. Finally liberated by the end of South Africa’s tyrannical white rule, Trevor and his mother set forth on a grand adventure, living openly and freely and embracing the opportunities won by a centuries-long struggle. Born a Crime is the story of a mischievous young boy who grows into a restless young man as he struggles to find himself in a world where he was never supposed to exist. It is also the story of that young man’s relationship with his fearless, rebellious, and fervently religious mother—his teammate, a woman determined to save her son from the cycle of poverty, violence, and abuse that would ultimately threaten her own life. The stories collected here are by turns hilarious, dramatic, and deeply affecting. Whether subsisting on caterpillars for dinner during hard times, being thrown from a moving car during an attempted kidnapping, or just trying to survive the life-and-death pitfalls of dating in high school, Trevor illuminates his curious world with an incisive wit and unflinching honesty. His stories weave together to form a moving and searingly funny portrait of a boy making his way through a damaged world in a dangerous time, armed only with a keen sense of humor and a mother’s unconventional, unconditional love.”"

The people, places, and possibilities in my life. Surrender is a word freighted with meaning for me. Growing up in Ireland in the seventies with my fists up (musically speaking), it was not a natural concept. A word I only circled until I gathered my thoughts for the book. I am still grappling with this most humbling of commands. In the band, in my marriage, in my faith, in my life as an activist. Surrender is the story of one pilgrim’s lack of progress … With a fair amount of fun along the way.” —Bono As one of the music world’s most iconic artists and the cofounder of the organizations ONE and (RED), Bono’s career has been written about extensively. But in Surrender, it’s Bono who picks up the pen, writing for the first time about his remarkable life and those he has shared it with. In his unique voice, Bono takes us from his early days growing up in Dublin, including the sudden loss of his mother when he was fourteen, to U2’s unlikely journey to become one of the world’s most influential rock bands, to his more than twenty years of activism dedicated to the fight against AIDS and extreme poverty. Writing with candor, self- reflection, and humor, Bono opens the aperture on his life—and the family, friends, and faith that have sustained, challenged, and shaped him. Surrender’s subtitle, 40 Songs, One Story, is a nod to the book’s forty chapters, which are each named after a U2 song. Bono has also created forty original drawings for Surrender, which appear throughout the book."

    "text": "The Undoing Project by Michael Lewis\n\n\nisbn-13: 9780393354775\nAudible\n“Forty years ago, Israeli psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky wrote a series of breathtakingly original studies undoing our assumptions about the decision-making process. Their papers showed the ways in which the human mind erred, systematically, when forced to make judgments in uncertain situations. Their work created the field of behavioral economics, revolutionized Big Data studies, advanced evidence-based medicine, led to a new approach to government regulation, and made much of Michael Lewis’s own work possible. Kahneman and Tversky are more responsible than anybody for the powerful trend to mistrust human intuition and defer to algorithms. The Undoing Project is about a compelling collaboration between two men who have the dimensions of great literary figures. They became heroes in the university and on the battlefield–both had important careers in the Israeli military–and their research was deeply linked to their extraordinary life experiences. Amos Tversky was a brilliant, self- confident warrior and extrovert, the center of rapt attention in any room; Kahneman, a fugitive from the Nazis in his childhood, was an introvert whose questing self-doubt was the seedbed of his ideas. They became one of the greatest partnerships in the history of science, working together so closely that they couldn’t remember whose brain originated which ideas, or who should claim credit. They flipped a coin to decide the lead authorship on the first paper they wrote, and simply alternated thereafter. This story about the workings of the human mind is explored through the personalities of two fascinating individuals so fundamentally different from each other that they seem unlikely friends or colleagues. In the process they may well have changed, for good, mankind’s view of its own mind.”"

    "text": "Introduction\nStefan Zweig’s Montaigne is a biography written under extraordinary circumstances. Drafted in Brazil during the final months of Zweig’s life (1941–1942), the work is as much a reflection on the author’s own era as it is a study of the 16th-century French philosopher. Zweig, a Jewish intellectual in exile from Nazi-occupied Europe, discovered a profound kinship with Michel de Montaigne, seeing him not merely as a historical subject but as a “soul brother” and a guide for survival in barbaric times [1]. This book, which remains an unfinished fragment due to Zweig’s suicide, is less a traditional linear biography and more a personal meditation on how to maintain intellectual integrity when the world descends into madness. It stands as a testament to the enduring power of humanism and the sanctuary of the individual mind."

    "section": "Overview of the key points",
    "text": "Overview of the key points\nThe central narrative of the book tracks Montaigne’s deliberate withdrawal from public life. Zweig highlights how Montaigne, living through the chaotic French Wars of Religion, chose to resign from his public office and retreat to his famous tower. Zweig interprets this not as an act of cowardice or escapism, but as a heroic and necessary effort to save his own soul [3]. By stepping back, Montaigne refused to serve the fanatical ideologies of either the Catholics or the Protestants, choosing instead to serve the truth of his own experience. This act of self-preservation allowed him to remain human in an inhuman age.\nZweig draws a sharp and deliberate parallel between Montaigne’s 16th century and his own 20th century. He argues that both eras were plagued by “herd” madness, where dogmatism and totalitarians threatened to crush the individual spirit [1]. In this context, Montaigne’s writing becomes a form of salvation. In a world where nothing was certain and external authorities were corrupt, Montaigne turned his gaze inward, observing his own changing self as the only stable reality. This “biography of a mind” emphasizes that Montaigne’s greatest achievement was not his public service, but his relentless quest to understand and preserve his own inner nature."

    "title": "Montaigne",
    "section": "Overview of the key themes",
    "text": "Overview of the key themes\n\nInner Freedom\nThe dominant theme of the work is the preservation of inner freedom. Zweig portrays Montaigne as the ultimate champion of liberty—specifically, the liberty to think and feel for oneself regardless of external pressures. In an age of enforced conformity, Montaigne’s insistence on the autonomy of his own conscience is presented as a radical and courageous act.\n\n\nThe “Citadel” of the Self\nZweig employs the metaphor of a “citadel” to describe the private realm of the individual. Referencing Montaigne’s physical tower, Zweig argues that every person must build a sanctuary that “no tyrant can breach.” This inner fortress is where one remains sovereign over their own thoughts, safe from the demands of the state, the church, or the mob [3].\n\n\nTolerance and Skepticism\nIn direct opposition to the ideological tyranny of his time, Zweig celebrates Montaigne’s skepticism. The famous motto “Que sais-je?” (“What do I know?”) is depicted not as indecision, but as a powerful antidote to murderous certainty. Zweig suggests that true tolerance is born from this admission of ignorance; if one admits they do not possess the absolute truth, they are less likely to kill others for disagreeing with them.\n\n\nWithdrawal and Mortality\nThe theme of withdrawal is treated with profound sympathy, reflecting Zweig’s own desire to escape the horrors of World War II. Furthermore, Zweig dwells significantly on Montaigne’s stoic approach to death, famously summarizing that “to philosophize is to learn to die.” These passages are often read as a haunting foreshadowing of Zweig’s own decision to exercise the “last freedom” of choosing his own end [3]."

    "text": "Conclusion\nMontaigne is widely regarded as Stefan Zweig’s “last will and testament.” It is a poignant defense of humanism and a guide to intellectual survival in a collapsing world. Although the text is unfinished, it possesses a tragic coherence, ending with a sense of resolve that speaks to the author’s final days. Zweig successfully resurrects Montaigne not just as a Renaissance figure, but as a contemporary ally for anyone struggling to remain an individual in an age of mass movements. It is a powerful reminder that even when the world is consumed by fire, the freedom of the inner self remains a fortress that cannot be taken."

    "text": "The Right It by Alberto Savoia\n\n\nisbn-13: 9780062884657\nHardcover\nAlbert Savoia makes a compelling case for how to improve the odds of your new product succeeding in the marketplace, with a number of practical tips and tools to go along with the theory.\n\nTheory\n• The Law of Market Failure: Most new ideas will fail in the market-even if competently executed.\n• Most new ideas fail in the market because they are The Wrong It-ideas that the market is not interested in regardless of how well they are executed.\n• Your best chance for succeeding in the market is to combine an idea that is The Right It with competent execution.\n• You cannot depend on your intuition, other people’s opinions, or other people’s data to determine if a new idea is The Right It.\n• The most reliable way to determine if a new idea is likely to be The Right It is to collect Your Own DAta (YODA).\n\n\nXYZ Hypothesis\nAt least X% of Y will Z.\nX% is a specific percentage of your target market. Y is a clear description of your target market. Z is how you expect the market will engage with your idea.\n\n\nHypozooming\nThe goal of hypozooming is to take a specific but broad hypothesis and zoom in until you have a version of that hypothesis that is actionable and testable right now. It’s a way to go from XYZ to xyz, a smaller, simpler, more immediately verifiable version of your Market Engagement Hypothesis. The idea is that if XYZ is true, then xyz must also be true-but xyz is much easier to test and verify.\n\n\nPretotypes\nPrototypes and pretotypes serve different functions. Prototypes are primarily designed to test if an idea for a product or service can be built, how it should be built, how (and if) it will work, what’s the best size or shape for it, and so on.\nPretotypes, on the other hand, are designed primarily to validate, quickly and cheaply, if an idea is worth pursuing and building in the first place -a different objective that is best accomplished with a different set of techniques and best served by having its own vocabulary.\n\n\nTRI Meter\nThe Right It Meter, TRI Meter for short, is a visual analysis tool to help you interpret the YODA you’ve collected as objectively as possible. More precisely, the TRI Meter is a gauge to help you estimate how likely it is that an idea will succeed in the market, but it’s a gauge that is not too technical, complicated, or confusing - which can easily happen whenever probability and statistics are involved.\n\n\nSkin-in-the-game Caliper\nAssign skin-in-the-game “points” to different types of target market responses. The caliper can be customized for specific products and markets.\n\n\nOverall process\n\nStart with an idea.\nIdentify the Market Engagement Hypothesis.\nTurn the MEH into a say-it-with-numbers XYZ Hypothesis.\nHypozoom into a set of smaller, easier to test xyx hypotheses.\nUse pretotyping techniques to run experiments and collect YODA.\nUse the TRI Meter with the Skin-in-the-Game Caliper to help you analyze the YODA.\nDecide on the next step:\n\n\nGo for it! You can’t be 100% sure that your idea is The Right It, but the YODA looks promising enough for you to take a calculated risk.\nDrop it. As much as you’d like your idea to succeed, the YODA stubbornly indicates otherwise.\nTweak it. In the process of testing your idea, you have learned invaluable things about your target market and its willingness (or unwillingness) to engage with your product. Don’t hesitate to tweak your original idea (or your hypotheses) to reflect what you’ve learned along the way. You may find that although there is not enough market interest in your original idea, there may be great interest in something related to it. Or try flipping the idea on its head and see what you come up with.\n\nPublisher’s Description: “The Law of Market Failure: Most new products will fail in the market, even if competently executed. Using his experience at Google, his remarkable success as an entrepreneur and consultant, and insights from his lectures at Stanford University and Google, Alberto Savoia’s The Right It offers an unparalleled approach to beating the beast that is market failure. Millions of people around the world are working hard to bring to life new ideas. Some of these ideas will turn out to be stunning successes that will have a major impact on our world and our culture: The next Google, the next Polio vaccine, the next Harry Potter, the next Red Cross, the next Ford Mustang. Others will be smaller, more personal but no less meaningful, successes: A little restaurant that becomes a neighborhood favorite, a biography that does not make the best-seller list but tells an important story, a local nonprofit to care for abandoned pets. At this very same moment, another group of people is working equally hard to develop new ideas that, when launched, will fail. Some of them will fail spectacularly and publicly: like New Coke, the movie “John Carter”, or the Ford Edsel. Others will be smaller, more private, but no less painful failures: A home-based business that never takes off, a children’s book that neither publishers nor children have any interest in, a charity for a cause that too few people care enough about. If you are currently working to develop a new idea, whether on your own or as part of a team, which group are you in? Most people believe that they either are, or will be, in the first group—the group whose ideas will be successful. All they have to do is work hard and execute well. Unfortunately, we know that this cannot be the case. The law of market failure tells us that up to 90 percent of most new products, services, businesses, and initiatives will fail soon after they are launched—regardless of how promising they sound, how much we commit to them, or how well we execute them. This is a hard fact to accept. We believe that other people fail because they don’t know what they are doing. Somehow, we believe that this does not apply to us and to our idea—especially if we’ve experienced victories in the past. Filled with detailed case studies, a lesson on creating your own hard data, a strategy for market engagement, and an introduction to the concept of a pretotype (not a prototype), The Right It is a groundbreaking, entertaining, and highly practical book delivers a proven formula for turning ideas, products, services, and businesses into successful endeavors. As Alberto writes, “make sure you are building The Right It before you build It right”.”"

    "text": "On The Edge: The Art of Risking Everything by Nate Silver\n\n\nisbn-13: 9780563537618\nHardcover\nQuite a lengthy book, ostensibly about risk-taking. Practically it cames across a book with three loosely related sections: the first about gambling, focused primarily on poker, but also delving into slot-machines and sports betting. The second part is about Sam Bankman-Fried, his cryptocurrency startup and the Effective Altruism movement. The third part is about rise of GenAI and the risk that AI will cause the end of humanity - p(doom)\nThe gambling section was the longest and most detailed - it might have been more interesting if I was a gambler. Not uninteresting, just not a compelling read for me personally.\n\n\nMuslims are religiously forbidden to gamble\nThe section os Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) was the weakest in my opinion. I thought that Number Go Up did a much better job of detailing the follies of SBF.\nI am likewise ambivalent about final chapters on p(doom). They were interesting enough but I just feel that humanity is involved in many other activities with a higher p(doom).\nProbably the most valuable chapter was entitled “Inspiration: Thirteen Habits of Highly Succesful Risk Takers”. These, according to Silver, are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteThirteen Habits of Highly Succesful Risk Takers\n\n\n\n\nSuccessful risk-takers are cool under pressure. They don’t try to be heroes, but they can execute when the chips are down.\nSuccessful risk-takers have courage. They’re insanely competitive and their attitude is: bring it on.\nSuccessful risk-takers have strategic empathy. They put themselve in their opponent’s shoes.\nSuccessful risk-takers are process oriented, not results oriented. They play the long game.\nSuccessful risk-takers take shots. They are explicitly aware of the risks they’re taking - and they’re comfortable with failure.\nSuccessful risktakers take a raise-or-fold attitude toward life. They abhor mediocrity and they know when to quit.\nSuccessful risk-takers are prepared. They make good intuitive decisions because they’re well trained-not because they “wing it.”\nSuccessful risk-takers have selectively high attention to detail. They understand that attention is a scarce resource and think carefully about how to allocate it.\nSuccessful risk-takers are adaptable. They are good generalists, taking advantage of new opportunities and responding to new threats.\nSuccessful risk-takers are good estimators. They are Bayesians, comfortable quantifying their intuitions and working with incomplete information.\nSuccessful risk-takers try to stand out, not fit in. They have independence of mind and purpose.\n\n\n\nQuotes\n\nCoates believes that much of what accounts for the “irrational exuberance” that makes for financial bubbles are these biological factors. Traders can experience euphoria. A bull market “releases cortisol, and in combination with dopamine, one of the most addictive drugs known to the human brain, it delivers a narcotic hit, a rush, a flow that convinces traders there is no other job in the world.” Chapter 2: Perception p91\n\n\nGiven the mathematical complexities of the game, you might expect poker to fall into System 2. And indeed, this is how computers approach poker. Despite constant improvements in processing power, solvers still take several minutes to come up with an approximate solution to a single poker hand. And yet, experienced human players, who have more factors to weigh than computers-not just the math but the psychology-often come to a decision in just a few seconds. So maybe the distinction between System 2 and System 1 is fuzzier than is commonly assumed. System 2 tasks can become System 1 tasks with enough practice. Chapter 2: Perception p103\n\n\n…here’s one stereotype that bears out both in my own life and in empirical research: women, on average, are more likely to form bonds by talking, while men are more likely to form bonds by doing things together. Chapter 2: Perception p119\n\n\nThe average slot hold on the Las Vegas Strip is above 8 percent, however. And it’s even higher-around 11 percent-on penny slots, which are the most likely games for casual gamblers to encounter. Among the most common forms of government-sanctioned gambling, the only worse deals for players are horse racing and state lotteries, which are essentially a regressive tax on low and middle income citizens. Chapter 2: Perception p164\n\n\n“One of the things that con artists take advantage of is the fact that the human brain hates uncertainty and always craves some sort of a story - cause and effect, something that makes sense. And whenever the world is changing, and a lot of things are happening at once, it’s hard for the average mind to deal with it,” Maria Konnikova told me. Crypto gurus like Mashinsky and Bankman-Fried offered the authority that people desperately wanted. Con artists “give you a nice little narrative to make sense” of the world, Konnikova said. “They take advantage of that moment to give you the certainty you crave.” Chapter 6: Illusion p313\n\n\nIt’s common in the River, a highly secular place, to insult someone’s movement by comparing it to a religion. (For instance, you might say that wokeness is a religion or that effective altruism is one.) Chapter 3: Illusion p327\n\n\nHere is a famous conundrum posed by the economist Thomas Schelling: You are to meet somebody in New York City. You have not been instructed where to meet; you have no prior understanding with the person on where to meet; and you cannot communicate with each other. You are simply told that you will have to guess where to meet and that he is being told the same thing and that you will just have to try to make your guesses coincide. Chapter 3: Illusion p327\n\n\nAccording to the French historian René Girard - Peter Thiel’s favorite philosopher - this tendency to mirror what other people covet, what he calls “mimetic desire,” is at the very heart of the human condition. And when you combine mimetic desire with modern-day meme culture - “mime” and “mimetic” have the same Greek root word, mīmēma, meaning that which is imitated - you’ll wind up with prices for NFTs that fluctuate wildly as collectors signal to one another what should be a focal point and what is out of style. Chapter 3: Illusion p331\n\n\nTo Altman, it was like embarking on the Manhattan Project. In one interview, he even paraphrased Robert Oppenheimer, with whom he shares a birthday: “Technology happens because it is possible.” At first, this sounds like the sort of motivational pabulum that might be stenciled on the wall of a Sunnyvale startup. But Oppenheimer, who spent the latter third of his life haunted by his role in fathering the atomic bomb, had implied something darker than Altman’s rephrasing. “It is a profound and necessary truth that the deep things in science are not found because they are useful; they are found because it was possible to find them,” Oppenheimer said. Long ago, humankind ate fruit from the tree of knowledge, then began to scale the branches of scientific and technological achievement. It’s those of us who go where the action is who move humanity forward-and who might bring about its demise. Although some might prefer to live ignorantly in an eternal paradise, we are irresistibly drawn toward the path of risk-and reward. Chapter Infinity: Termination p407\n\n\n“The place [ChatGPT] struggles the most is in places where humans require really thorough and longform decomposition and reasoning,” Ryder said-for instance, solving a mathematical proof. “Type 2 thinking is very foreign to language models, because it’s not how they’re trained at all.” Conversely, “when it comes to Type 1 thinking, they just completely ace it.” Chapter Infinity: Termination p431\n\n\nPut another way, it’s not that machines can do things more powerfully than humans that’s disconcerting. That’s been true since we began inventing machines; humanity is not threatened because a Chevy Bolt is faster than Usain Bolt. Rather, it’s that we’ve never invented a machine that worked so well but known so little about how it worked. Chapter Infinity: Termination p434\n\nPublisher’s Description\nFrom the New York Times bestselling author of The Signal and the Noise, the definitive guide to our era of risk—and the players raising the stakes\nIn the bestselling The Signal and the Noise, Nate Silver showed how forecasting would define the age of Big Data. Now, in this timely and riveting new book, Silver investigates “the River,” the community of like-minded people whose mastery of risk allows them to shape—and dominate—so much of modern life.\nThese professional risk-takers—poker players and hedge fund managers, crypto true believers and blue-chip art collectors—can teach us much about navigating the uncertainty of the twenty-first century. By immersing himself in the worlds of Doyle Brunson, Peter Thiel, Sam Bankman-Fried, Sam Altman, and many others, Silver offers insight into a range of issues that affect us all, from the frontiers of finance to the future of AI.\nMost of us don’t have traits commonly found in the River: high tolerance for risk, appreciation of uncertainty, affinity for numbers—paired with an instinctive distrust of conventional wisdom and a competitive drive so intense it can border on irrational. For those in the River, complexity is baked in, and the work is how to navigate it. People in the River have increasing amounts of wealth and power in our society, and understanding their mindset—and the flaws in their thinking— is key to understanding what drives technology and the global economy today.\nTaking us behind the scenes from casinos to venture capital firms, and from the FTX inner sanctum to meetings of the effective altruism movement, On the Edge is a deeply reported, all-access journey into a hidden world of power bro­kers and risk-takers."

A scandal and vicious rumor concerning the Binat family have destroyed their fortune and prospects for desirable marriages, but Alys, the second and most practical of the five Binat daughters, has found happiness teaching English literature to schoolgirls. Knowing that many of her students won’t make it to graduation before dropping out to marry and have children, Alys teaches them about Jane Austen and her other literary heroes and hopes to inspire the girls to dream of more. When an invitation arrives to the biggest wedding their small town has seen in years, Mrs. Binat, certain that their luck is about to change, excitedly sets to work preparing her daughters to fish for rich, eligible bachelors. On the first night of the festivities, Alys’s lovely older sister, Jena, catches the eye of Fahad “Bungles” Bingla, the wildly successful–and single–entrepreneur. But Bungles’s friend Valentine Darsee is clearly unimpressed by the Binat family. Alys accidentally overhears his unflattering assessment of her and quickly dismisses him and his snobbish ways. As the days of lavish wedding parties unfold, the Binats wait breathlessly to see if Jena will land a proposal–and Alys begins to realize that Darsee’s brusque manner may be hiding a very different man from the one she saw at first glance. Told with wry wit and colorful prose, Unmarriageable is a charming update on Jane Austen’s beloved novel and an exhilarating exploration of love, marriage, class, and sisterhood. Advance praise for Unmarriageable “[A] funny, sometimes romantic, often thought- provoking glimpse into Pakistani culture, one which adroitly illustrates the double standards women face when navigating sex, love, and marriage. This is a must-read for devout Austenites.”–Publishers Weekly (starred review) “Unmarriageable is a joy to read! It transforms a familiar story into something new and fresh and different, but keeps all of the warmth and intelligence of the original. I loved everything about these characters and spending time in their world.”–Jasmine Guillory, author of The Wedding Date “Unmarriageable raises an eyebrow at a society that views marriage as the ultimate prize for women. Crackling with witty dialogue, family tensions, humor, and rich details of life in contemporary Pakistan, it tells an entirely new story about love, luck, and literature.”–Balli Kaur Jaswal"

When buying the book, I noticed that Your First 100 Days in a New Executive Job was available for free as part of the Kindle Unlimited program which I am a member of, so I got that too.\nWhen I want to learn about a topic, I often find myself getting two or three books on it. I find (or am afraid) that a single book will only provide a one-dimensional view and I like gettting second and third opinions.\nThe The New Leader’s 100-Day Action Plan feels the more comprehensive of the two books. It’s organized into four parts:\n\nBecome the Best Candidate for the Job\nDiscover Your New Role\nTake Control of Your Own Start\nImplement Your 100-Day Action Plan\n\nAs mine was an internal move, parts 2 and 3 were more relevant for me.

Your First 100 Days in a New Executive Job has a reasonably similar approach to The New Leader’s 100-Day Action Plan.

A series of high-profile wins in his hometown of East Long Beach have made him so notorious that he can hardly go to the corner store without being recognized. Dodson, once his sidekick, is now his full- fledged partner, hell-bent on giving IQ’s PI business some real legitimacy: a Facebook page, and IQ’s promise to stop accepting Christmas sweaters and carpet cleanings in exchange for PI services. So when a young painter approaches IQ for help tracking down her missing mother, it’s not just the case Isaiah’s looking for, but the human connection. And when his new confidant turns out to be connected to a dangerous paramilitary operation, IQ falls victim to a threat even a genius can’t see coming. Waiting for Isaiah around every corner is Seb, the Oxford-educated African gangster who was responsible for the death of his brother, Marcus. Only, this time, Isaiah’s not alone. Joined by a new love interest and his familiar band of accomplices, IQ is back–and the adventures are better than ever.”"

It’s a blazing summer when two men arrive in a small village in the West of Ireland. One of them is coming home. Both of them are coming to get rich. One of them is coming to die. Cal Hooper took early retirement from Chicago PD and moved to rural Ireland looking for peace. He’s found it, more or less: he’s built a relationship with a local woman, Lena, and he’s gradually turning Trey Reddy from a half-feral teenager into a good kid going good places. But then Trey’s long-absent father reappears, bringing along an English millionaire and a scheme to find gold in the townland, and suddenly everything the three of them have been building is under threat. Cal and Lena are both ready to do whatever it takes to protect Trey, but Trey doesn’t want protecting. What she wants is revenge. From the writer who is “in a class by herself,” (The New York Times), a nuanced, atmospheric tale that explores what we’ll do for our loved ones, what we’ll do for revenge, and what we sacrifice when the two collide."

Like Funny in Farsi much is made of the eccentricities of the author’s father.\nI enjoyed reading this and gained a new appreciation for Mandvi but strangely he doesn’t ‘click’ with me. Perhaps the way he and I see the world is just too far out of sync.\nPublisher’s Description: ““It always bothered me that Aasif was more than merely funny-he’s also a great actor. Now I’ve learned he’s an amazing storyteller as well, and I am furious . . . but also grateful. Aasif’s movement between cultures and genres is what makes him and his story singularly funny, poignant, and essential.” - John Hodgman, author of The Areas of My Expertise and More Information Than You Require “My father moved our family to the United States because of a word. It was a word whose meaning fascinated him. It was a singularly American word, a fat word, a word that could only be spoken with decadent pride. That word was . . . Brunch! ‘The beauty of America,’ he would say, ‘is they have so much food, that between breakfast and lunch they have to stop and eat again.’” —from “International House of Patel” If you’re an Indo-Muslim-British-American actor who has spent more time in bars than mosques over the past few decades, turns out it’s a little tough to explain who you are or where you are from. In No Land’s Man Aasif Mandvi explores this and other conundrums through stories about his family, ambition, desire, and culture that range from dealing with his brunch-obsessed father, to being a high-school-age Michael Jackson impersonator, to joining a Bible study group in order to seduce a nice Christian girl, to improbably becoming America’s favorite Muslim/Indian/Arab/Brown/Doctor correspondent on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart. This is a book filled with passion, discovery, and humor. Mandvi hilariously and poignantly describes a journey that will resonate with anyone who has had to navigate his or her way in the murky space between lands. Or anyone who really loves brunch.”"

When Tomo introduces a deceptive new product that preys on users’ fears to drive up its own revenue, Angie sees Tomo for what it really is–another evil abuser. Using her coding and hacking expertise, she decides to destroy Tomo by building a new social network that is completely distributed, compartmentalized, and unstoppable. If she succeeds, it will be the end of all centralized power in the Internet.

Where do secrets live? Carol is a divorced teacher living in a small town in Ireland, her only son now grown. A second chance at love brings her unexpected connection and belonging–and sparks a flurry of speculation. What does a woman like her see in a man like that? What happened to his wife who abandoned him and his children all those years ago? Carol and Declan know their relationship is the talk of the town, but the gossip only serves to bring the couple closer. When Declan becomes ill, their relationship falters. His children are untrusting and cruel, and Carol is forced to leave their beloved home, with its worn oak floors and elegant features, and move back with her parents. Carol’s mother is determined to get to the bottom of things–she won’t see her daughter suffer this way. It seems there are secrets in Declan’s past, strange rumors that were never confronted, and suddenly the house they shared takes on a more sinister significance that affects them all."

Each targeted simply for being Muslim – each attack a consequence of the insidious rise in Islamophobia in Britain.\nFrom the far-right violence that broke out in the summer of 2024 to the hatred directed at Muslims in public life during the Gaza conflict, anti-Muslim racism is dangerously out-of-control. Fed by a network of media outlets, think tanks, commentators, and even the entertainment industry, Islamophobia not only passes the dinner table test but is also Britain’s bigotry blind spot. For too many, Muslims Don’t Matter.\nIn this incisive polemic, Britain’s first Muslim Cabinet minister, Conservative peer, campaigner and podcaster Sayeeda Warsi uses her dual experience at the centre of British power and in the heart of our Muslim communities to unapologetically challenge the corrosive consensus. As Muslims terrified by the riots seriously consider whether Britain should still be their home, Warsi urges us to change course, to unite and dismantle this toxic bigotry."

As a retired brain surgeon, Henry Marsh thought he understood illness, but he was unprepared for the impact of his diagnosis of advanced cancer. And Finally explores what happens when someone who has spent a lifetime on the frontline of life and death finds himself contemplating what might be his own death sentence. As he navigates the bewildering transition from doctor to patient, he is haunted by past failures and projects yet to be completed, and frustrated by the inconveniences of illness and old age. But he is also more entranced than ever by the mysteries of science and the brain, the beauty of the natural world and his love for his family. Elegiac, candid, luminous and poignant, And Finally is ultimately not so much a book about death, but a book about life and what matters in the end."

Crucially, Haber emphasizes that possessing the skills is insufficient without the disposition to use them. A critical thinker must possess “intellectual virtues” such as open-mindedness, inquisitiveness, and truth-seeking."

Haber navigates this by proposing “High-Leverage Critical Thinking Practices”—skills that are explicitly taught but deliberately applied across different disciplines to ensure transferability.\n\n“We can and should teach critical thinking as a distinct subject, but we must also ensure that students learn to apply these skills within and across the disciplines.” (Chapter 3)"

Spurred on by the obligation she felt to her working-class immigrant family, she rose through the ranks and saw it all: out-of-control, lavish parties flowing with never-ending drinks; affairs flouted in the office; rampant drug use; and most pervasively, a discriminatory culture that seemed designed to hold back the few women and people of color employed at the company. Despite Goldman Sachs having the right talking points and statistics, Fiore Higgins soon realized that these provided a veneer to cover up what she found to be an abusive culture. Her account is one filled with shocking stories of harassment and jaw-dropping tales of exclusionary behavior: when she was told she only got promoted because she is a woman; when her coworkers mooed at her after she pumped for her fourth child, defying the superior who had advised her not to breastfeed; or when a male boss used a racial epithet in front of her, other colleagues, and clients without any repercussions. Bully Market sounds the alarm on the culture of finance and corporate America, while offering clear, actionable ideas for creating a fairer workplace. Both a revealing, extraordinary look at the industry and a top Wall Streeter’s explosive personal story, Bully Market is an essential account of one woman’s experience in a flawed system that speaks to the challenge and urgency for change.”"

    "text": "Funny In Farsi by Firoozeh Dumas\n\n\nisbn-13: 9780812968378\nAudible\nMildly amusing memoir of an Iranian family’s American immigrant experience. A series of stories and anecdotes many of them revolving around the eccentricities of the author’s father. Some quite funny stories, some a little twee. Somehow the book didn’t really resonate with me the way I thought it would.\nPublisher’s Description: “NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • Finalist for the PEN/USA Award in Creative Nonfiction, the Thurber Prize for American Humor, and the Audie Award in Biography/Memoir This Random House Reader’s Circle edition includes a reading group guide and a conversation between Firoozeh Dumas and Khaled Hosseini, author of The Kite Runner! “Remarkable . . . told with wry humor shorn of sentimentality . . . In the end, what sticks with the reader is an exuberant immigrant embrace of America.”—San Francisco Chronicle In 1972, when she was seven, Firoozeh Dumas and her family moved from Iran to Southern California, arriving with no firsthand knowledge of this country beyond her father’s glowing memories of his graduate school years here. More family soon followed, and the clan has been here ever since. Funny in Farsi chronicles the American journey of Dumas’s wonderfully engaging family: her engineer father, a sweetly quixotic dreamer who first sought riches on Bowling for Dollars and in Las Vegas, and later lost his job during the Iranian revolution; her elegant mother, who never fully mastered English (nor cared to); her uncle, who combated the effects of American fast food with an army of miraculous American weight-loss gadgets; and Firoozeh herself, who as a girl changed her name to Julie, and who encountered a second wave of culture shock when she met and married a Frenchman, becoming part of a one-couple melting pot. In a series of deftly drawn scenes, we watch the family grapple with American English (hot dogs and hush puppies?—a complete mystery), American traditions (Thanksgiving turkey?—an even greater mystery, since it tastes like nothing), and American culture (Firoozeh’s parents laugh uproariously at Bob Hope on television, although they don’t get the jokes even when she translates them into Farsi). Above all, this is an unforgettable story of identity, discovery, and the power of family love. It is a book that will leave us all laughing—without an accent. Praise for Funny in Farsi “Heartfelt and hilarious—in any language.”—Glamour “A joyful success.”—Newsday “What’s charming beyond the humor of this memoir is that it remains affectionate even in the weakest, most tenuous moments for the culture. It’s the brilliance of true sophistication at work.”—Los Angeles Times Book Review “Often hilarious, always interesting . . . Like the movie My Big Fat Greek Wedding, this book describes with humor the intersection and overlapping of two cultures.”—The Providence Journal “A humorous and introspective chronicle of a life filled with love—of family, country, and heritage.”—Jimmy Carter “Delightfully refreshing.”—Milwaukee Journal Sentinel “[Funny in Farsi] brings us closer to discovering what it means to be an American.”—San Jose Mercury News”"

Funny, touching, and wonderfully thought-provoking, while also capturing the changes in America and American culture since World War II. Part One of this story takes place in 1947. A troubled soldier, returning from the war, meets his talented five-year-old nephew, leaves an indelible impression, and then disappears for twenty-three years. Cut to 1970: The nephew, now drawing underground comic books in Oakland, California, reconnects with his uncle and, remembering the comic book he saw when he was five, draws a new version with his uncle as a World War II fighting hero. Cut to the present day: A commercially successful director discovers the 1970 comic book and decides to turn it into a contemporary superhero movie. Cue the cast: We meet the film’s extremely difficult male star, his wonderful leading lady, the eccentric writer/director, the producer, the gofer production assistant, and everyone else on both sides of the camera. Bonus material: Interspersed throughout are three comic books that are featured in the story—all created by Tom Hanks himself—including the comic book that becomes the official tie-in to this novel’s “major motion picture masterpiece.”"

    "text": "How to Know a Person: The Art of Seeing Others Deeply and Being Deeply Seen by David Brooks\n\n\nisbn-13: 9780593230060\nAudible\nPublisher’s Description\nNEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • A practical, heartfelt guide to the art of truly knowing another person in order to foster deeper connections at home, at work, and throughout our lives—from the author of The Road to Character and The Second Mountain As David Brooks observes, “There is one skill that lies at the heart of any healthy person, family, school, community organization, or society: the ability to see someone else deeply and make them feel seen—to accurately know another person, to let them feel valued, heard, and understood.” And yet we humans don’t do this well. All around us are people who feel invisible, unseen, misunderstood. In How to Know a Person, Brooks sets out to help us do better, posing questions that are essential for all of us: If you want to know a person, what kind of attention should you cast on them? What kind of conversations should you have? What parts of a person’s story should you pay attention to? Driven by his trademark sense of curiosity and his determination to grow as a person, Brooks draws from the fields of psychology and neuroscience and from the worlds of theater, philosophy, history, and education to present a welcoming, hopeful, integrated approach to human connection. How to Know a Person helps readers become more understanding and considerate toward others, and to find the joy that comes from being seen. Along the way it offers a possible remedy for a society that is riven by fragmentation, hostility, and misperception. The act of seeing another person, Brooks argues, is profoundly creative: How can we look somebody in the eye and see something large in them, and in turn, see something larger in ourselves? How to Know a Person is for anyone searching for connection, and yearning to be understood."

    "text": "Introduction\nThere Is No Antimemetics Division is a science fiction horror novel by qntm (Sam Hughes). While originally published as a series of stories on the SCP Foundation Wiki, the 2025 Random House edition (ISBN 9780593983751) presents the narrative as a standalone novel, refining the terminology while maintaining the core story [1][5]. The novel is set within a secretive organization dedicated to securing and containing paranormal anomalies that threaten reality. The focus of the story is the titular Antimemetics Division, a department responsible for containing “antimemes”—ideas, entities, or objects with self-censoring properties. These anomalies naturally erase themselves from human memory, meaning that once an observer looks away, they immediately forget what they saw [2]. As a result, the Division faces a unique existential horror: they are an organization that no one, not even the rest of their own agency, remembers exists, often fighting wars that are forgotten the moment they are won."

    "text": "Overview of the story\nThe narrative follows a non-linear structure that escalates from procedural investigation to apocalyptic survival. It begins with Marie Quinn, the Chief of the Antimemetics Division, who is constantly battling the side effects of “mnestics”—memory-enhancing drugs required to perceive the threats she hunts. She identifies a looming, catastrophic threat: an aggressive, sentient antimemetic complex known as SCP-3125 (or “The Adversary” in some editions). This entity is not a physical monster but a hostile idea system from outside standard reality that invades the human “noosphere” (the realm of thought) [5]. It kills anyone who fully perceives it, erasing them and their associates from existence.\nAs the story progresses, Quinn realizes that the war against 3125 has been ongoing for years, but her team keeps losing and forgetting their defeats. The conflict reaches a breaking point when 3125 fully manifests, dismantling the Division and conquering human consciousness. The narrative perspective then shifts to Adam Quinn, Marie estranged husband. Previously hidden away and memory-wiped for his protection, Adam possesses a rare natural immunity to antimemetic effects. In a post-apocalyptic world where the enemy rules openly but invisibly, Adam must piece together his fragmented identity and finish the mission Marie started, transitioning the story from a secret agent thriller to a desperate survival saga [5]."

Unlike Marie, he starts with no knowledge of the anomalous world. His journey is one of discovery and endurance. His natural resistance to antimemes makes him the only person capable of seeing the world as it truly is without being destroyed by it, positioning him as the “action survivor” who must carry the torch when the experts have fallen [5].\nSCP-3125 acts as the primary antagonist. It is a “five-dimensional” meme complex that functions as a cosmic predator of information. It thrives on secrecy and destroys any mind that becomes aware of it. It manifests through human avatars and cults, representing an ultimate, unknowable existential threat [5].\nSimon Lee a researcher who keeps losing pieces of his own career to the very threats he studies.\nClay appears initially as an internal auditor sent to evaluate the Division but is revealed to be a “human-shaped antimeme,” a construct created by 3125 to infiltrate the organization, highlighting the paranoia-inducing nature of the enemy."

Characters are forced to trust notes left by their past selves, highlighting the fragility of human consciousness [2].\nCosmic horror is central to the narrative, but it is distinct from traditional physical monsters. The threat is conceptual; the horror stems from the inability to know one is at war. This ties into the theme of bureaucracy and isolation. The Antimemetics Division is isolated not by physical barriers but by the cognitive inability of others to perceive them. This creates a profound sense of nihilism and duty, as the characters die to save a world that is incapable of acknowledging their sacrifice [5].\nFinally, the story contrasts existential nihilism with human connection. While 3125 represents a void of meaning—a hateful, consuming nothingness—the narrative suggests that the bond between Marion and Adam is the only force resilient enough to challenge it.\n\nSources\n\n[1] eBay Listing & Random House: Confirmed 2025 Hardcover Edition details and ISBN\n[2] Reddit (r/SCPDeclassified): “There Is No Antimemetics Division [Part 1] - We Need To Talk About Fifty-Five”: https://www.reddit.com/r/SCPDeclassified/comments/7296q3/there_is_no_antimemetics_division_part_1_we_need/\n[3] qntm.org: Author’s official site and landing page for the book\n[4] SCP Wiki: “Antimemetics Division Hub”: https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/antimemetics-division-hub\n[5] TV Tropes: “Literature / There Is No Antimemetics Division”: https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThereIsNoAntimemeticsDivision"

As Scott Kraft’s right-hand woman, whip-smart Sophia is in the eye of the storm, sometimes floundering, sometimes nearly losing relationships and her health, but ultimately learning what it means to take charge of her own future the way the men around her do. But when engineer/inventor Andre Stark hires her to run his company’s investor relations, Sophia discovers that the big paycheck and high-status career she’s created for herself may not be worth living in the toxic environment of a boys-club gone bad.”"

It was nothing more than a one-night stand. Juliana Brody, a judge in the Superior Court of Massachusetts, is rumored to be in consideration for the federal circuit, maybe someday the highest court in the land. At a conference in a Chicago hotel, she meets a gentle, vulnerable man and has an unforgettable night with him–something she’d never done before. They part with an explicit understanding that this must never happen again. But back home in Boston, Juliana realizes that this was no random encounter. The man from Chicago proves to have an integral role in a case she’s presiding over–a sex-discrimination case that’s received national attention. Juliana discovers that she’s been entrapped, her night of infidelity captured on video. Strings are being pulled in high places, a terrifying unfolding conspiracy that will turn her life upside down. But soon it becomes clear that personal humiliation, even the possible destruction of her career, are the least of her concerns, as her own life and the lives of her family are put in mortal jeopardy. In the end, turning the tables on her adversaries will require her to be as ruthless as they are."

    "text": "Overview of the story\nThe central mystery ignites when a German tourist discovers a body submerged in a peat bog in Galway. While the preservation of the corpse initially suggests an ancient ritual sacrifice typical of Iron Age “bog bodies,” pathologist Dr. Yvonne Connelly soon confirms the victim is a modern man: Thaddeus Grey, a local secondary school principal who had vanished two years prior. The investigation, led by DS Cormac Reilly, reveals that the body has been subjected to ritualistic mutilation mimicking ancient torture methods, deepening the mystery surrounding Grey, a man known for his authoritarian nature [2].\nThe case quickly escalates beyond a single homicide. Shortly after the initial discovery, two more mutilated bodies are found in bogs across Ireland, sparking a media frenzy and fears of a serial killer. This pressure leads to the involvement of a younger Detective Inspector from Dublin who fixates on the serial killer theory, potentially sidelining Cormac’s own instincts.\nParallel to the murder investigation, Cormac faces a personal crisis when his ex-girlfriend, Emma Sweeney, returns to his life. Pregnant and desperate, she pleads for Cormac’s help in finding her missing husband, Finn O’Ceallaigh, who has disappeared during a business trip to Paris. Additionally, a distinct subplot unfolds involving Carl Rigney, a corrupt cybersecurity expert plotting to rig the Irish Lottery software, adding a layer of high-tech fraud to the narrative [2]."

He is being pushed to apply for a promotion within Internal Affairs, a move that would remove him from the field but allow him to combat corruption from within. Throughout the novel, he is depicted as increasingly isolated, torn between his official duties on the bog body case and his unauthorized, personal investigation into Emma’s missing husband [2].\nGarda Peter Fisher, Cormac’s trusted colleague, is also navigating personal turmoil. Dealing with a difficult domestic violence case involving a family friend, Peter is secretly contemplating leaving the force to emigrate to Australia. His relationship with Cormac is tested as both men conceal their future plans from one another.\nEmma Sweeney, Cormac’s former partner, serves as a catalyst for much of the personal drama. Her return and desperation to find her husband force Cormac into ethical grey areas. Thaddeus Grey, the victim, is revealed to be a strict and unpopular figure whose past holds the key to the central mystery. Meanwhile, Carl Rigney provides a villainous contrast as an antagonist involved in white-collar crime [2]."

The setting of the bog serves as a powerful metaphor, bridging ancient history with modern-day crimes and preserving secrets that refuse to stay buried. The narrative juxtaposes the primal nature of the ritualistic murders with contemporary issues like cyber fraud and domestic abuse [2].\nA central conflict for Cormac is Professional Duty vs. Personal Loyalty. He is constantly pulled between his sworn obligations to the Garda and the murder investigation, and his lingering loyalty to Emma. This struggle highlights the ethical compromises that often accompany deep personal connections.\nThe story also delves into Institutions and Corruption. With Cormac considering a move to Internal Affairs and the subplot involving the manipulation of a national lottery, the book examines the fragility of trusted systems and the rot that can occur from the inside. Finally, themes of Transition and Displacement are prominent, as both Cormac and Peter stand on the precipice of major life changes, grappling with restlessness and the difficulty of moving forward [2]."

While the weaving of four distinct plotlines—the bog murders, the serial killer theory, the Paris disappearance, and the lottery fraud—creates a complex narrative, it ultimately delivers a cohesive and addictive reading experience. It resolves long-standing character arcs while setting the stage for new beginnings, solidifying McTiernan’s reputation as a master of Irish crime fiction [2]."

Luckily, he turned out to be very good. The book is set in post-financial crisis Dublin, but a Dublin almost stripped of it’s Irishness and populated by a multinational jet-set elite who never venture far from the International Finacial Center district. There’s lots of biting criticism here of the excesses of the financial world both pre and post-crisis. The story is more of a farce than I remember Skippy Dies being and didn’t quite hit the hights of that book for me. Still all in all, enjoyable read."

    "text": "Upstream - The Quest To Solve Problems Before They Happen by Dan Heath\n\n\nisbn-13: 9781982134723\nAudible\nPublisher’s Description: “New York Times bestselling author Dan Heath explores how to prevent problems before they happen, drawing on insights from hundreds of interviews with unconventional problem solvers. So often in life, we get stuck in a cycle of response. We put out fires. We deal with emergencies. We stay downstream, handling one problem after another, but we never make our way upstream to fix the systems that caused the problems. Cops chase robbers, doctors treat patients with chronic illnesses, and call-center reps address customer complaints. But many crimes, chronic illnesses, and customer complaints are preventable. So why do our efforts skew so heavily toward reaction rather than prevention? Upstream probes the psychological forces that push us downstream—including “problem blindness,” which can leave us oblivious to serious problems in our midst. And Heath introduces us to the thinkers who have overcome these obstacles and scored massive victories by switching to an upstream mindset. One online travel website prevented twenty million customer service calls every year by making some simple tweaks to its booking system. A major urban school district cut its dropout rate in half after it figured out that it could predict which students would drop out—as early as the ninth grade. A European nation almost eliminated teenage alcohol and drug abuse by deliberately changing the nation’s culture. And one EMS system accelerated the emergency-response time of its ambulances by using data to predict where 911 calls would emerge—and forward-deploying its ambulances to stand by in those areas. Upstream delivers practical solutions for preventing problems rather than reacting to them. How many problems in our lives and in society are we tolerating simply because we’ve forgotten that we can fix them?”"

The dead girl is carrying an ID that will put this crime at the center of a scandal–her card identifies her as Carline Darcy, heir apparent to Darcy Therapeutics, Ireland’s most successful pharmaceutical company.

But what about all the angry old people who can’t let go?\nFor young Americans a generation from now, climate change isn’t controversial. It’s just an overwhelming fact of life. And so are the great efforts to contain and mitigate it. Entire cities are being moved inland from the rising seas. Vast clean-energy projects are springing up everywhere. Disaster relief, the mitigation of floods and superstorms, has become a skill for which tens of millions of people are trained every year. The effort is global. It employs everyone who wants to work.

To their “alternative” news sources that reassure them that their resentment is right and pure and that “climate change” is just a giant scam.\nAnd they’re your grandfather, your uncle, your great-aunt. And they’re not going anywhere. And they’re armed to the teeth.\nThe Lost Cause asks: What do we do about people who cling to the belief that their own children are the enemy?

    "text": "Plot Summary and Narrative Arc\nThe story is set in the dystopian nation of Panem during the lead-up to and execution of the 50th Hunger Games. As a Quarter Quell, this event is marked by a unique twist to the standard rules, dictated by the founding documents of the Games. For the Second Quarter Quell, the Capitol decrees that two male and two female tributes must be reaped from each district, doubling the total number of participants to forty-eight.\nThe narrative centers on Haymitch Abernathy, a youth from District 12. While specific plot beats of the novel await publication, the established canon within Catching Fire provides the historical framework for the story arc. Haymitch is selected alongside three other tributes from District 12, including Maysilee Donner. The arc follows the reaping ceremony, the preparation in the Capitol, and the lethal competition within the arena.\nThe arena for the 50th Games is described in established lore as a deceptively beautiful landscape teeming with poisonous flora and fauna. The central conflict involves Haymitch navigating this environment and forming temporary alliances. The climax of the arc historically hinges on Haymitch’s discovery of a force field at the edge of the arena. In the final confrontation, he utilizes the force field’s recoil mechanism to defeat his last opponent, a girl from District 1, resulting in his victory. The resolution explores the immediate aftermath of this win, specifically how the Capitol, under President Snow, perceives Haymitch’s use of the force field not as cleverness, but as an act of rebellion that exposed a flaw in the Games’ design."

    "text": "Character Analysis\n\nHaymitch Abernathy: The protagonist is presented at a younger age, prior to the cynicism and alcoholism that define his character in the original trilogy. The narrative examines his physical capabilities, intelligence, and the psychological toll of the arena. His development focuses on the transition from a District 12 citizen to a victor, highlighting the specific trauma that leads to his eventual isolation.\nMaysilee Donner: As a fellow tribute from District 12 and the aunt of Madge Undersee (a character from the original trilogy), Maysilee serves as a significant secondary character. Her relationship with Haymitch provides emotional stakes within the arena.\nCoriolanus Snow: Now firmly established as the President of Panem, Snow serves as the overarching antagonist. His characterization connects the ambitious youth seen in The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes with the tyrannical ruler of The Hunger Games. The book examines his methods of maintaining order and his reaction to actions he perceives as defying Capitol authority."

    "section": "Key Themes and Messages",
    "text": "Key Themes and Messages\n\nImplicit Submission and Governance\nAuthor Suzanne Collins has stated that the thematic foundation of Sunrise on the Reaping is inspired by Scottish philosopher David Hume, specifically his ideas regarding implicit submission. The text explores “the easiness with which the many are governed by the few,” examining how the Capitol maintains control over the districts not just through physical force, but through the psychological acquiescence of the population.\n\n\nThe Nature of Propaganda\nThe novel investigates the use of media and spectacle to enforce state power. By doubling the number of dead tributes, the Second Quarter Quell serves as a heightened form of terror-as-entertainment, designed to remind the districts of their powerlessness. The narrative scrutinizes how the “truth” of the Games is manufactured and disseminated to the public.\n\n\nAgency vs. Determinism\nThrough Haymitch’s journey, the story addresses the limits of individual agency within a totalitarian system. While Haymitch wins the Games through his own ingenuity, the subsequent punishment inflicted upon him (the canon elimination of his loved ones) reinforces the theme that in Panem, no individual is truly outside the state’s reach, and every victory comes with a mandated cost."

    "section": "Story Arc and Plot Summary",
    "text": "Story Arc and Plot Summary\nThe novel is structured into three distinct acts: “The Mentor,” “The Prize,” and “The Peacekeeper.”\nThe story begins with eighteen-year-old Coriolanus Snow, who is outwardly a student of the Academy but privately struggling to maintain the appearance of wealth. The Snow family—comprising Coriolanus, his cousin Tigris, and his grandmother, the Grandma’am—is destitute, their fortune lost during the war. Coriolanus views the upcoming 10th Hunger Games as his only path to university and a restored reputation. For the first time, Academy students are assigned as mentors to the tributes to increase viewer engagement. Snow is assigned the female tribute from District 12, a charismatic performer named Lucy Gray Baird.\nUnlike the warrior tributes of later years, the 10th Games are crude. Tributes are treated as prisoners of war, kept in a zoo, and starved. Snow realizes that to win, he must not only ensure Lucy Gray’s survival but also make the Games a spectacle. He introduces the concept of betting and sponsorship to the Head Gamemaker, Dr. Volumnia Gaul.\nThe narrative follows the mentorship, wherein Snow bonds with Lucy Gray, driven by a mix of genuine infatuation and possessive ambition. He cheats to aid her, providing her with a compact to carry rat poison and slipping a scent-laden handkerchief into a tank of genetically modified snakes to ensure they will not attack her in the arena. Lucy Gray wins the Games, but Snow’s deception is discovered by Dean Casca Highbottom, the creator of the Games.\nAs punishment, Snow is conscripted as a Peacekeeper and sent to District 12. There, he reunites with Lucy Gray and is joined by Sejanus Plinth, a former Academy classmate from a wealthy District 2 family who has joined the Peacekeepers out of moral conflict. In District 12, Snow navigates a complex dynamic of romance with Lucy Gray and duty to the Capitol. When Sejanus becomes involved in a rebel plot to help escapees flee north, Snow secretly records Sejanus’s plans and sends them to Dr. Gaul via jabberjay, resulting in Sejanus’s execution for treason.\nThe climax occurs in the wilderness. Snow and Lucy Gray attempt to run away together to escape the crackdown in District 12. However, upon finding hidden weapons that link Snow to a previous murder, paranoia sets in. Snow realizes that Lucy Gray is the only loose end tying him to his crimes. Their relationship dissolves into a hunt; Lucy Gray disappears, leaving a trap involving a snake that bites Snow, and Snow fires his rifle into the woods, though her fate is left ambiguous.\nSnow returns to the Capitol, having been honorably discharged due to Dr. Gaul’s intervention. He is embraced as Gaul’s protégé, poisons Dean Highbottom, and sets himself on the path to becoming the tyrannical President Snow."

    "text": "Character Development\n\nCoriolanus Snow: The narrative is strictly anchored in Snow’s perspective. Initially, he appears as a sympathetic underdog trying to survive poverty. However, Collins meticulously peels back these layers to reveal a narcissist who views love as a liability and people as possessions. His development is a descent into sociopathy. His internal monologue reveals that his actions, even those that appear benevolent, are calculated for self-preservation or advancement. He concludes that “what he needed was not a chaotic songbird, but a guide.”\nLucy Gray Baird: A member of the Covey (a traveling musical group), Lucy Gray is a performer who understands how to manipulate an audience. She serves as a foil to Katniss Everdeen; where Katniss is a reluctant survivalist, Lucy Gray is a charming showwoman. She represents the “Songbird”—freedom, art, and unpredictability. Her character highlights Snow’s inability to control nature.\nSejanus Plinth: Sejanus acts as the moral conscience of the novel. His empathy for the tributes and disdain for the Capitol’s brutality stand in stark contrast to Snow’s pragmatism. His death is the catalyst that solidifies Snow’s loyalty to the Capitol’s authoritarian order.\nDr. Volumnia Gaul: The Head Gamemaker and a twisted mentor figure to Snow. She uses the Games as an experimental lab to prove her Hobbesian worldview: that humanity is inherently violent and requires a totalitarian state (the Capitol) to maintain order."

    "section": "Themes and Messages",
    "text": "Themes and Messages\n\nThe State of Nature and the Social Contract:\nThe central philosophical debate of the book concerns the purpose of the Hunger Games. Through Dr. Gaul, Collins invokes Thomas Hobbes’s Leviathan. Gaul argues that without the Capitol’s strict control, humanity would devolve into a chaotic “state of nature” where life is nasty, brutish, and short. The Games are not just punishment, but a reminder of who humans truly are without law. Snow ultimately embraces this philosophy, believing that control is the only defense against chaos.\n\n“The Hunger Games are an exhibition… Not of the tributes. Of us. Of what we’re capable of.” — Dr. Volumnia Gaul\n\n\n\nSpectacle and Media Manipulation:\nThe novel details the origin of the Games as a media event. It illustrates the transition from a mere execution of children to a televised entertainment product. Snow realizes that to keep the Districts in line and the Capitol engaged, the audience must care about the victims before watching them die. This theme critiques the consumption of violence as entertainment.\n\n\nControl vs. Chaos:\nThe title references two opposing forces. Songbirds (Lucy Gray, the Mockingjays) represent uncontrollable nature, music, and civil disobedience. Snakes (Snow, Dr. Gaul) represent calculated control, poison, and authoritarianism. Snow’s hatred of the Mockingjays—birds that the Capitol failed to control—foreshadows his future conflicts. He desires a world where everything is structured and owned.\n\n“Snow lands on top.” — The Snow family motto.\n\n\n\nThe Complexity of Evil:\nCollins avoids presenting Snow as a monster from birth. Instead, she illustrates how a combination of trauma, societal pressure, and a series of moral compromises can construct a tyrant. Snow chooses power over love and order over morality, rationalizing his cruelty as necessary for the survival of civilization.\nThe book concludes by bridging the gap to the original trilogy, explaining the origins of specific elements such as the song “The Hanging Tree,” the hatred of Mockingjays, and the strategic use of food and poison as weapons of political control."

I wish I could go back in time and gift it to my younger self. It would’ve helped me find a more joyful path to progress.” —Serena Williams, 23-time Grand Slam singles tennis champion The #1 New York Times bestselling author of Think Again illuminates how we can elevate ourselves and others to unexpected heights. We live in a world that’s obsessed with talent. We celebrate gifted students in school, natural athletes in sports, and child prodigies in music. But admiring people who start out with innate advantages leads us to overlook the distance we ourselves can travel. We underestimate the range of skills that we can learn and how good we can become. We can all improve at improving. And when opportunity doesn’t knock, there are ways to build a door. Hidden Potential offers a new framework for raising aspirations and exceeding expectations. Adam Grant weaves together groundbreaking evidence, surprising insights, and vivid storytelling that takes us from the classroom to the boardroom, the playground to the Olympics, and underground to outer space. He shows that progress depends less on how hard you work than how well you learn. Growth is not about the genius you possess—it’s about the character you develop. Grant explores how to build the character skills and motivational structures to realize our own potential, and how to design systems that create opportunities for those who have been underrated and overlooked. Many writers have chronicled the habits of superstars who accomplish great things. This book reveals how anyone can rise to achieve greater things. The true measure of your potential is not the height of the peak you’ve reached, but how far you’ve climbed to get there."

    "text": "Do No Harm: Stories of Life, Death, and Brain Surgery by Henry Marsh\nWhen Breath Becomes Air by Paul Kalanithi\nBeing Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End by Atul Gowande\n\nI read these three books all on a medical theme in a row. They were three of the best books I read all year - all highly recommended. (I actually listened to the audiobook version of all three - I can recommend the audio versions of Do No Harm and Being Mortal, but found the narrator of When Breath Becomes Air to be insufferable - I suggest you stick to the print or ebook version of that book.) They each provide a different viewpoint on life and death, without being overly morose or heavy. Do No Harm is a series of vignettes by retired British neurosurgeon, Dr Henry Marsh. It is a truly compelling read with insights into life, death, medicine, success, failure and much more besides. The author is refreshingly honest about his failures as a surgeon in addition to the soaring successes. I didnt think I’d like it as much as I did. One to go back to again. When Breath Becomes Air ended up on many best-of-2016 lists, and deservedly so. The book is a memoir of a by-all-accounts brilliant young neurosurgeon, nearing the end of his training, who is diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. The author is..was.. a gifted writer as well as a talented surgeon, and it shows in this book. He started writing the book after the diagnosis and died before he could fully complete it. It’s a book that forces to think deeply about life, death and everything in between. The title comes from Caelica 83, a poem by Baron Brooke Fulke Greville:\n\nYou that seek what life is in death, Now find it air that once was breath. New names unknown, old names gone: Till time end bodies, but souls none. Reader! then make time, while you be, But steps to your eternity.\n\nBeing Mortal is an exploration of aging and death, and our society’s approach to end-of-life care. I really enjoyed Gowande’s book The Checklist Manifesto and his occasional articles in The New Yorker and thought this book was thought-provoking, moving and eloquent. A must-read, especially for those of us with aging parents, or indeed anyone who hopes to live to an old age."

Fascinating story, told in Mezrich’s typical breathless style. They’re all a bunch of unsavory characters though so this book fails to land any emotional impact other than a feeling of distaste.\nisbn-13: 9781476771892\nAudible\nPublisher’s Description: “The bestselling author of Bringing Down the House (sixty-three weeks on the New York Times bestseller list and the basis for the hit movie 21) and The Accidental Billionaires (the basis for the Academy Award–winning film The Social Network) delivers an epic drama of wealth, rivalry, and betrayal among mega-wealthy Russian oligarchs—and its international repercussions. Once Upon a Time in Russia is the untold true story of the larger-than-life billionaire oligarchs who surfed the waves of privatization to reap riches after the fall of the Soviet regime: “Godfather of the Kremlin” Boris Berezovsky, a former mathematician whose first entrepreneurial venture was running an automobile reselling business, and Roman Abramovich, his dashing young protégé who built a multi-billion-dollar empire of oil and aluminum. Locked in a complex, uniquely Russian partnership, Berezovsky and Abramovich battled their way through the “Wild East” of Russia with Berezovsky acting as the younger man’s krysha—literally, his roof, his protector. Written with the heart-stopping pacing of a thriller—but even more compelling because it is true—this story of amassing obscene wealth and power depicts a rarefied world seldom seen up close. Under Berezovsky’s krysha, Abramovich built one of Russia’s largest oil companies from the ground up and in exchange made cash deliveries—including 491 million dollars in just one year. But their relationship frayed when Berezovsky attacked President Vladimir Putin in the media—and had to flee to the UK. Abramovich continued to prosper. Dead bodies trailed Berezovsky’s footsteps, and threats followed him to London, where an associate of his died painfully and famously of Polonium poisoning. Then Berezovsky himself was later found dead, declared a suicide. Exclusively sourced, capturing a momentous period in recent world history, Once Upon a Time in Russia is at once personal and political, offering an unprecedented look into the wealth, corruption, and power behind what Graydon Carter called “the story of our age.””"

I’m not particularly a crime-fiction addict but have gotten addicted to Connelly’s writing and his characters and the LA setting for his stories. The main character, Harry Bosch, is (over the series of books) so richly drawn that he almost feels real to me. Amazon created the Bosch tv series a few years back, and its pretty good, but doesn’t compare to the Bosch that I’ve built in my head over the years from reading the books.\nIn the overall body of work, The Wrong Side of Goodbye doesn’t particularly stand out. For a Connelly fan though, it’s essential reading. One of the signs of the quality of the writing for me is that I’m barely conscious of the writing - you just slip into the story and get carried along. &gt; “Everybody counts or nobody counts” - Harry Bosch"

    "text": "Introduction\n“Mindreader: The New Science of Deciphering What People Really Think, What They Really Want, and Who They Really Are” by David J. Lieberman explores the field of “psycholinguistics” to help readers understand the thoughts and intentions of others [1]. Moving beyond traditional body language analysis, which Lieberman argues can be easily manipulated, this book focuses on the spoken and written word as a more reliable window into the subconscious [2]. Lieberman, a psychotherapist and instructor for U.S. law enforcement agencies, presents methods for detecting deception and assessing mental health by analyzing grammatical structures and word choices [3]."

    "section": "Overview of the Key Points",
    "text": "Overview of the Key Points\nThe book is structured around two primary objectives: lie detection and psychological profiling. A central component of Lieberman’s approach is the analysis of “function words”—such as pronouns, prepositions, and articles—which research suggests can reveal a speaker’s true state of mind [1].\n\nLinguistic Analysis and Lie Detection\nLieberman details several specific linguistic markers that indicate deception. One such marker is the use of pronouns; honest individuals typically use personal pronouns like “I” to take ownership of their actions, whereas those concealing the truth often use “distancing language,” such as “we” or “you,” to psychologically separate themselves from their statements [1]. Additionally, the use of passive voice (e.g., “mistakes were made” rather than “I made a mistake”) is highlighted as a common tactic to deflect responsibility [1].\nAnother key technique involves analyzing the structure of a story. Truthful narratives usually contain rich sensory details—sights, sounds, and smells—whereas fabricated stories often lack this depth or focus excessively on irrelevant preamble to distract the listener [1]. The book also warns against “absolutist” language; the frequent use of binary terms like “always,” “never,” or “everyone” can indicate anxiety or emotional instability, as opposed to the nuanced perspective of a healthy mind [1].\n\n\nAssessing Emotional Health\nBeyond spotting lies, the book provides tools for evaluating long-term personality traits. Lieberman introduces the concept of “ego-syntonic” behavior, where an individual’s actions align with their self-image. This concept helps in distinguishing between genuine self-esteem and fragile egotism. The author suggests that high ego often masks low self-esteem, noting that truly confident people rarely feel the need to broadcast their self-worth [1]."

    "text": "Overview of the Key Themes\n\nThe Shift from Visual to Verbal Cues\nA recurring theme is the necessity of adapting to a digital world where face-to-face interactions are diminishing. With the prevalence of email and texting, visual cues like crossed arms or averted eyes are often unavailable, making the ability to analyze the text itself crucial [1].\n\n\nSelf-Esteem versus Egotism\nThe book posits an inverse relationship between self-esteem and egotism. Lieberman argues that insecurity often manifests as bravado, while genuine self-esteem is quiet and self-sustaining. This distinction is vital for identifying toxic personalities and establishing healthy relationships [2].\n\n\nNarrative Identity and Reality\nLieberman emphasizes the importance of understanding a person’s “narrative identity”—the internal story they tell about themselves. Since people rarely act in contradiction to this internal narrative, understanding it allows for better behavioral prediction. Furthermore, the book explores the link between mental health and the ability to accept reality, suggesting that the inability to process reality without distortion is a root cause of many personality disorders [1]."

    "text": "All Our Wrong Todays by Elan Mastai\n\n\nisbn-13: 9781101985137\nAudible\nI’m a sucker for time-travel books and this is one of two great time-travel books I’ve read this year - the other being A Gift of Time. Both of them take some effort to think through (in their own ways) some of the practical questions around time travel - e.g. do your clothes travel with you? what if you materialize into a solid object? etc.\nAll Our Wrong Todays is the jokier of the two, but has its more profound moments too. I was particularly intrigued by the author’s reference to French philosopher Paul Virilio’s idea of the “integral accident”.\nA quote from the book:\n\nCat’s Cradle is about a lot of things, but a major plot thread involves the invention of ice-nine, a substance that freezes everything it touches, which falls out of its creator’s control and destroys all life on the planet.\nLionel Goettreider read Cat’s Cradle and had a crucial realization, what he called the “Accident”— when you invent a new technology, you also invent the accident of that technology.\nWhen you invent the car, you also invent the car accident. When you invent the plane, you also invent the plane crash. When you invent nuclear fission, you also invent the nuclear meltdown. When you invent ice-nine, you also invent unintentionally freezing the planet solid.\nWhen Lionel Goettreider invented the Goettreider Engine, he knew he couldn’t turn it on until he figured out its accident—and how to prevent it.\n\nPublisher’s Description: “There’s no such thing as the life you’re”supposed” to have… You know the future that people in the 1950s imagined we’d have? Well, it happened. In Tom Barren’s 2016, humanity thrives in a techno-utopian paradise of flying cars, moving sidewalks, and moon bases, where avocados never go bad and punk rock never existed . . . because it wasn’t necessary. Except Tom just can’t seem to find his place in this dazzling, idealistic world, and that’s before his life gets turned upside down. Utterly blindsided by an accident of fate, Tom makes a rash decision that drastically changes not only his own life but the very fabric of the universe itself. In a time-travel mishap, Tom finds himself stranded in our 2016, what we think of as the real world. For Tom, our normal reality seems like a dystopian wasteland. But when he discovers wonderfully unexpected versions of his family, his career, and–maybe, just maybe–his soul mate, Tom has a decision to make. Does he fix the flow of history, bringing his utopian universe back into existence, or does he try to forge a new life in our messy, unpredictable reality? Tom’s search for the answer takes him across countries, continents, and timelines in a quest to figure out, finally, who he really is and what his future–our future–is supposed to be. All Our Wrong Todays is about the versions of ourselves that we shed and grow into over time. It is a story of friendship and family, of unexpected journeys and alternate paths, and of love in its multitude of forms. Filled with humor and heart, and saturated with insight and intelligence and a mind-bending talent for invention, this novel signals the arrival of a major talent.”"

This time, their lives may never be the same. Isaiah is no longer IQ, the genius of East Long Beach; instead he’s a man on the road and on the run, hiding in a small Northern California town when his room is broken into by a desperate young man on the trail of the state’s most prolific serial killer. Dodson must go straight or lose his wife and child. His devil’s bargain is an internship at an LA advertising agency, where it turns out the rules of the street have simply been dressed in business casual, but where the aging company’s fortunes may well rest on their ability to attract a younger demographic. Dodson -”the hustler’s hustler” - just may be the right man for the job. Ide is the crime writer’s crime writer, and he’s filled his best novel with desperate souls, courageous outcasts, an ex-stripper who’ll do anything to protect her son, and half-brothers who may be the very incarnation of evil. Filled with deft plotting, lacerating humor, and a keen eye for the ways in which characters rise or fall based on their ties to one another, SMOKE is Joe Ide’s crowning achievement.”"

As one of the first female F-14 Tomcat fighter pilots in the US Navy, as well as a mom, wife, business consultant, Wall Street Journal bestselling author, and global speaker, author Carey Lohrenz knows that the stress we experience can be just as intense as the stress in the cockpit of a fighter jet going Mach 2. But she’s got a secret weapon to prevail: years of training to overcome the specific natures of uncertainty, stress, burnout, anxiety, and pressure. At our core, we know we’ve lost control. We’ve lost our grip on what we really want and who we really want to be. In order to solve the challenges of chaos and make our goals, dreams, and commitments a reality, we have to understand that in order to succeed when the pressure is on and to improve our performance overall, we’ve got to know what we can and cannot control. In Span of Control, Lohrenz walks us through the fundamentals of surviving and succeeding during times of crisis. Weaving together eye-opening science, gripping personal stories, insightful interviews, prescriptive advice, and a high-octane dose of encouragement and practicality, Span of Control helps leaders recognize how to focus on what matters most, formulate a plan for success, and communicate what’s possible.”"

    "section": "Key Points",
    "text": "Key Points\n\nThe Origins of Clearview AI:\nThe narrative centers on Hoan Ton-That, an Australian computer engineer who moved to the U.S. and initially struggled to find success in the tech industry. After a series of failed ventures and viral apps, Ton-That partnered with Richard Schwartz, a politically connected associate of Rudy Giuliani. Together, they capitalized on advancements in neural networks to create a facial recognition tool that utilized the vast, publicly accessible images found on social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Venmo.\n\n\nThe “Taboo” of Big Tech:\nHill documents that tech giants such as Google and Facebook possessed the capability to create similar global facial search engines years before Clearview AI appeared. However, these companies deliberately chose not to release such tools due to the potential for abuse and severe privacy concerns. In 2011, Google chairman Eric Schmidt described facial recognition as the “only technology Google had built and, after looking at it, decided to stop” (p. 67), citing the likelihood of it being used by stalkers or repressive regimes.\n\n\nData Scraping Methodology:\nUnlike traditional law enforcement databases that rely on mugshots or driver’s license photos, Clearview AI scraped billions of images from the public internet without the subjects’ consent. The company operated on the premise that if information is public, it is fair game for collection, a stance that violated the Terms of Service of nearly every major social media platform.\n\n\nStealth Adoption by Law Enforcement:\nThe book details Clearview’s strategy of bypassing standard government procurement processes. The company offered free trials directly to individual officers and investigators, allowing the tech to spread rapidly through word-of-mouth among police departments, the FBI, and the Department of Homeland Security before high-level administrators were aware of its use.\n\n\nThe Erosion of Anonymity:\nA central theme of the book is the loss of “obscurity.” Hill argues that prior to Clearview, anonymity was the default state in public spaces. The widespread availability of this technology shifts the paradigm so that anyone can be identified instantly. As Hill writes, “We represent a threat to the privacy of the people we encounter just by looking at them through the lens of a smartphone” (p. 278).\n\n\nHigh-Profile Usage:\nThe text highlights specific instances where Clearview AI was utilized, including the identification of rioters following the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. While effective in solving crimes, the technology was also used controversially. Billionaire John Catsimatidis, a Clearview investor, used the app to identify his daughter’s date at a restaurant, illustrating the potential for personal misuse by the wealthy and powerful (p. 187).\n\n\nLegal Battles and Regulation:\nThe book outlines the legal challenges Clearview faces, particularly in Illinois, which has the Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA). This legislation, which requires consent for biometric data collection, posed the most significant existential threat to Clearview’s business model in the United States. Conversely, in Europe, GDPR laws effectively rendered Clearview’s database illegal.\n\n\nThe Unstoppable Nature of the Tech:\nHill concludes that while Clearview AI might be litigated or regulated, the technology itself cannot be uninvented. Open-source code and the availability of scraped data mean that the barrier to entry for creating a facial recognition engine has lowered significantly. The book suggests that society must now adapt to a world where faces are no longer private."

    "title": "Ergodicity: How irreversible outcomes affect long-term performance in work, investing, relationships, sport, and beyond",
    "section": "Summary of Key Points",
    "text": "Summary of Key Points\n\nDefinition of Ergodicity:\nThe central thesis of the book defines ergodicity through the relationship between ensemble averages (the average outcome of a group at a specific point in time) and time averages (the average outcome of a single individual over a long period). A system is ergodic only if these two averages are identical. Dellanna argues that most human endeavors—investing, careers, and health—are non-ergodic, meaning the group average does not predict the individual’s long-term experience.\n\n\nThe Problem with Expected Value:\nIn non-ergodic systems, relying on “expected value” (a concept derived from ensemble averages) is dangerous. For example, a gamble with a positive expected value but a risk of total ruin is acceptable for a group (the “house”) but catastrophic for an individual who cannot play again once ruined.\n\n\nIrreversibility and Ruin:\nThe primary differentiator in non-ergodic systems is the presence of “absorbing barriers” or irreversible states. In finance, this is bankruptcy; in health, it is death or permanent injury. Once an individual hits an absorbing barrier, they are removed from the system, rendering future probabilities irrelevant. Therefore, survival is the prerequisite for success.\n\n\nThe Russian Roulette Analogy:\nThe author utilizes the analogy of Russian Roulette to distinguish between risk and probability. If six people play Russian Roulette once for $1 million, five gain wealth and one dies; the ensemble average is positive. However, if one person plays Russian Roulette six times in a row, the probability of survival drops to zero. This illustrates why time averages differ from ensemble averages in the presence of systemic risk.\n\n\nAdditive vs. Multiplicative Dynamics:\nThe book posits that many real-world systems function on multiplicative dynamics (e.g., compound interest or reputation) rather than additive ones. In multiplicative systems, a single zero in the equation results in a total value of zero. Consequently, consistency and the avoidance of zeros are mathematically more impactful than maximizing the magnitude of wins.\n\n\nInvesting Strategy:\nDellanna applies ergodicity to portfolio management, arguing against the maximization of expected returns if it introduces the risk of ruin. He suggests that volatility drags down long-term compounded returns. An investor’s primary goal should be to maximize the geometric growth rate (time average) rather than the arithmetic average return.\n\n\nApplication to Career and Business:\nThe text extends the concept to professional life, suggesting that employees often optimize for short-term metrics (ensemble averages) to please management, while business owners must optimize for survival and long-term viability (time averages). This discrepancy creates a principal-agent problem where incentives are misaligned.\n\n\nAdaptability over Optimality:\nIn a non-ergodic world, conditions change, and risks are often opaque. The author argues that rigid optimization for a specific scenario is fragile. Instead, individuals should prioritize adaptability and “slack” (resources or time in reserve) to absorb shocks without hitting an irreversible state."

When a joint FBI-Seattle Police investigation of an international child pornography ring gets too close to certain powerful people, sex-crimes detective Livia Lone becomes the target of a hit that barely goes awry–a hit that had been offered to John Rain, a retired specialist in killings appearing to be from”natural causes.” Suspecting that the FBI themselves were behind the attack, Livia reaches out to former marine sniper Dox. Together, they assemble an ad hoc team to identify and neutralize the threat: Rain; Rain’s estranged lover, Mossad agent and honey-trap specialist Delilah; black op soldiers Ben Treven and Daniel Larison; and their former commander, SpecOps legend Colonel Scott “Hort” Horton. Moving from Japan to Seattle to DC to Paris, the group fights a series of interlocking conspiracies, each edging closer and closer to the highest levels of the US government. With uncertain loyalties, conflicting agendas, and smoldering romantic entanglements, this group is hardly a team. But in a match as uneven as this one, a collective of killers might be just what they need.”"

The novel has a number of clever conceits, such as the idea that the slaves would speak to each other in regular English when there were no Whites around, but would switch to a pidgin-English in the presence of Whites. In Everett’s telling Jim is educated and can read and write, a skill he hides from his slave masters. The novel lays bare the indignities of slavery and refutes the idea of there being “good slave owners”.\nThe only thing I didn’t really enjoy was the author’s evident atheism showing itself in Jim’s thinking. But that’s probably a reflection of my own biases also.\nPublisher’s Description\n#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER - NATIONAL BOOK AWARD WINNER - ONE OF THE NEW YORK TIMES BOOK REVIEW’S 10 BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR - SHORTLISTED FOR THE BOOKER PRIZE - KIRKUS PRIZE WINNER - A brilliant, action-packed reimagining of Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, both harrowing and darkly humorous, told from the enslaved Jim’s point of view In development as a feature film to be produced by Steven Spielberg - A Best Book of the Year: The New York Times Book Review, LA Times, The New Yorker, The Atlantic, The Economist, TIME, and more. “Genius”–The Atlantic - “A masterpiece that will help redefine one of the classics of American literature, while also being a major achievement on its own.”–Chicago Tribune - “A provocative, enlightening literary work of art.”–The Boston Globe - “Everett’s most thrilling novel, but also his most soulful.”–The New York Times When the enslaved Jim overhears that he is about to be sold to a man in New Orleans, separated from his wife and daughter forever, he decides to hide on nearby Jackson Island until he can formulate a plan. Meanwhile, Huck Finn has faked his own death to escape his violent father, recently returned to town. As all readers of American literature know, thus begins the dangerous and transcendent journey by raft down the Mississippi River toward the elusive and too-often-unreliable promise of the Free States and beyond. While many narrative set pieces of Adventures of Huckleberry Finn remain in place (floods and storms, stumbling across both unexpected death and unexpected treasure in the myriad stopping points along the river’s banks, encountering the scam artists posing as the Duke and Dauphin…), Jim’s agency, intelligence and compassion are shown in a radically new light. Brimming with the electrifying humor and lacerating observations that have made Everett a “literary icon” (Oprah Daily), and one of the most decorated writers of our lifetime, James is destined to be a cornerstone of twenty- first century American literature."

Meadows’ newly released manuscript, Thinking in Systems, is a concise and crucial book offering insight for problem solving on scales ranging from the personal to the global. Edited by the Sustainability Institute’s Diana Wright, this essential primer brings systems thinking out of the realm of computers and equations and into the tangible world, showing readers how to develop the systems-thinking skills that thought leaders across the globe consider critical for 21st-century life. Some of the biggest problems facing the world—war, hunger, poverty, and environmental degradation—are essentially system failures. They cannot be solved by fixing one piece in isolation from the others, because even seemingly minor details have enormous power to undermine the best efforts of too-narrow thinking. While readers will learn the conceptual tools and methods of systems thinking, the heart of the book is grander than methodology. Donella Meadows was known as much for nurturing positive outcomes as she was for delving into the science behind global dilemmas. She reminds readers to pay attention to what is important, not just what is quantifiable, to stay humble, and to stay a learner. In a world growing ever more complicated, crowded, and interdependent, Thinking in Systems helps readers avoid confusion and helplessness, the first step toward finding proactive and effective solutions.”"

Lewis described temperance as going to the ‘right length but no further.’ Easy to say, hard to practice - and if it was tough in 300 BC, or in the 1940s, it feels all but impossible today. Yet it’s the most empowering and important virtue any of us can learn.Without self-discipline, all our plans fall apart. Here, Ryan Holiday shows how to cultivate willpower, moderation and self-control in our lives. From Aristotle and Marcus Aurelius, to Toni Morrison and Queen Elizabeth II, he illuminates the great exemplars of its practice and what we can learn from them. Moderation is not about abstinence: it is about self-respect, focus and balance. Without it, even the most positive traits become vices. But with it, happiness and success are assured: the key is not more but finding the right amount."

Andie Stern thought she’d solved her final homicide. Once a budding FBI profiler, she gave up her career to raise her four (soon to be five) children in West Windsor, New Jersey. But one day, between soccer games, recitals, and trips to the local pool, a very pregnant Andie pulls into a gas station–and stumbles across a murder scene. An attendant has been killed, and the bumbling local cops are in way over their heads. Suddenly, Andie is obsessed with the case, and back on the trail of a killer, this time with kids in tow. She soon crosses paths with disgraced local journalist Kenneth Lee, who also has everything to prove in solving the case. A string of unusual occurrences–and, eventually, body parts–surface around town, and Andie and Kenneth uncover simmering racial tensions and a decades-old conspiracy. Hilarious, insightful, and a killer whodunit, Suburban Dicks is the one-of-a-kind mystery that readers will not be able to stop talking about.”"

Unfortunately not enough here in the first novel to entice me into continuing with the series.\nPublisher’s Description: “Gaius Petrius Ruso is a divorced and down-on his luck army doctor who has made the rash decision to seek his fortune in an inclement outpost of the Roman Empire, namely Britannia. His arrival in Deva (more commonly known as Chester, England) does little to improve his mood, and after a straight thirty six hour shift at the army hospital, he succumbs to a moment of weakness and rescues an injured slave girl, Tilla, from the hands of her abusive owner. Now he has a new problem: a slave who won’t talk and can’t cook, and drags trouble in her wake. Before he knows it, Ruso is caught in the middle of an investigation into the deaths of prostitutes working out of the local bar. A few years earlier, after he rescued Emperor Trajan from an earthquake in Antioch, Ruso seemed headed for glory: now he’s living among heathens in a vermin-infested bachelor pad and must summon all his forensic knowledge to find a killer who may be after him next. Who are the true barbarians, the conquered or the conquerors? It’s up to Ruso—certainly the most likeable sleuth to come out of the Roman Empire—to discover the truth. With a gift for comic timing and historic detail, Ruth Downie has conjured an ancient world as raucous and real as our own. Published in the UK as Medicus (Ruso) and the Disappearing Dancing Girls.”"

Adalyn Reyes has spent years perfecting her daily routine: wake up at dawn, drive to the Miami Flames FC offices, try her hardest to leave a mark, go home, and repeat. But her routine is disrupted when a video of her in an altercation with the team’s mascot goes viral. Rather than fire her, the team’s owner—who happens to be her father—sends Adalyn to middle-of-nowhere North Carolina, where she’s tasked with turning around the struggling local soccer team, the Green Warriors, as a way to redeem herself. Her plans crumble upon discovering that the players wear tutus to practice (impractical), keep pet goats (messy), and are terrified of Adalyn (counterproductive), and are nine-year-old kids. To make things worse, also in town is Cameron Caldani, goalkeeping prodigy whose presence is somewhat of a mystery. Cam is the perfect candidate to help Adalyn, but after one very unfortunate first encounter involving a rooster, Cam’s leg, and Adalyn’s bumper, he’s also set on running her out of town. But banishment is not an option for Adalyn. Not again. Helping this ragtag children’s team is her road to redemption, and she is playing the long game. With or without Cam’s help."

    "text": "Plot Summary and Narrative Arc\nThe story follows Jamie Babcock, a man who leads a seemingly mundane existence as a mid-level executive at a logistics firm. However, Jamie’s life is a fabrication; he is a “soft legend,” a paid employee of MI6 whose sole purpose is to maintain a legitimate cover identity. For years, Jamie has lived a boring, predictable life so that highly trained field agents can occasionally step into his shoes, utilizing his passport, credit history, and apartment to conduct operations under a solid alias. Jamie’s job is simply to exist and step aside when a “Hard Legend” (a real spy) needs to use his identity.\nThe status quo is shattered when the agent currently utilizing Jamie’s identity is killed in the field. Jamie is summoned by his handler, Sophie, and informed that the operation—a critical handover involving a Russian asset—cannot be aborted. Because the opposition expects to see “Jamie Babcock,” Jamie himself is coerced into completing the mission.\nThe narrative arc compresses a high volume of action into a short timeframe, primarily set across a single night in London. Jamie is tasked with securing a package related to a chemical weapon. The handover goes awry, resulting in a violent confrontation that leaves Jamie in possession of a lethal nerve agent while being hunted by Russian GRU hit squads.\nThe story progresses as a pursuit thriller. Jamie is forced to navigate the underground world of espionage without the requisite skills, relying instead on his knowledge of logistics, corporate bureaucracy, and sheer desperation. He is caught between the ruthless efficiency of the Russian assassins and the cold pragmatism of his MI6 handlers, who view him as an expendable asset necessary to contain a geopolitical catastrophe. The climax involves a confrontation where Jamie must outmaneuver the enemy not through firepower, but by exploiting the very mundane skills that made him a good cover identity in the first place."

    "text": "Character Analysis\n\nJamie Babcock: Jamie is characterized by his risk aversion and mediocrity. Unlike the protagonists of typical spy fiction, he is physically unimposing and terrified. His internal monologue frequently contrasts his terrifying reality with his desire for the safety of his dull office job. His development is marked by a shift from passivity to active survival. While he never transforms into an action hero, he learns to weaponize his invisibility and ordinary appearance.\nSophie: As Jamie’s handler, Sophie represents the institutional coldness of the intelligence community. She is professional, manipulative, and mission-focused. Her relationship with Jamie is transactional; while she offers guidance, the narrative makes it clear that she is willing to sacrifice him to protect state secrets. Her character underscores the theme that intelligence work often lacks moral sentimentality.\nThe Antagonists: The opposing forces are depicted as highly competent and lethal, serving as a foil to Jamie’s ineptitude. Their presence heightens the tension, as the disparity between their skills and Jamie’s lack of training creates a consistent sense of imminent failure."

The concept of the “soft legend” highlights the administrative side of spycraft—the need for paperwork, credit scores, and believable backstories.\nIdentity and Performance: A central theme is the fluidity of identity. Jamie has spent years “performing” the role of a normal man for the benefit of the state. When he is forced to operate in the field, the line between the man and the cover blurs. The book explores what it means to be a “nobody” and how anonymity can be both a prison and a shield.\nExpendability: The novel critically examines the value of human life within intelligence operations. Jamie realizes early on that to his employers, he is merely a tool that has malfunctioned. The narrative questions the morality of sacrificing the individual for the perceived greater good, stripping away the romanticism often associated with service to one’s country."

The tone is often darkly humorous, derived from the absurdity of Jamie’s situation—such as worrying about expensing a taxi ride while fleeing from assassins. The author avoids deifying the intelligence services, presenting a gritty, often cynical view of modern espionage."

After mother of five and former FBI profiler Andie Stern solved a murder—and unraveled a decades-old conspiracy—in her New Jersey town, both her husband and the West Windsor police hoped that she would set aside crime-fighting and go back to carpools, changing diapers, and lunches with her group of mom-friends, who she secretly calls The Cellulitists. Even so, Andie can’t help but get involved when the husband of Queen Bee Molly Goode is found dead. Though all signs point to natural causes, Andie begins to dig into the case and soon risks more than just the clique’s wrath, because what she discovers might hit shockingly close to home. Meanwhile, journalist Kenny Lee is enjoying a rehabilitated image after his success as Andie’s sidekick. But when an anonymous phone call tips him off that Molly Goode killed her husband, he’s soon drawn back into the thicket of suburban scandals, uncovering secrets, affairs, and a huge sum of money. Hellbent on justice and hoping not to kill each other in the process, Andie and Kenny dust off their suburban sleuthing caps once again.”"

Domain-specific Knowledge Graph Construction (KGC) is an active research area that has recently witnessed impressive advances due to machine learning techniques like deep neural networks and word embeddings. This book will synthesize Knowledge Graph Construction over Web Data in an engaging and accessible manner. The book will describe a timely topic for both early -and mid-career researchers. Every year, more papers continue to be published on knowledge graph construction, especially for difficult Web domains. This work would serve as a useful reference, as well as an accessible but rigorous overview of this body of work. The book will present interdisciplinary connections when possible to engage researchers looking for new ideas or synergies. This will allow the book to be marketed in multiple venues and conferences. The book will also appeal to practitioners in industry and data scientists since it will have chapters on both data collection, as well as a chapter on querying and off-the-shelf implementations. The author has, and continues to, present on this topic at large and important conferences. He plans to make the powerpoint he presents available as a supplement to the work. This will draw a natural audience for the book. Some of the reviewers are unsure about his position in the community but that seems to be more a function of his age rather than his relative expertise. I agree with some of the reviewers that the title is a little complicated. I would recommend “Domain Specific Knowledge Graphs”.”"

You can agree or disagree with Smil—accept or doubt his ‘just the facts’ posture—but you probably shouldn’t ignore him.”—The Washington Post An essential analysis of the modern science and technology that makes our twenty-first century lives possible—a scientist’s investigation into what science really does, and does not, accomplish. We have never had so much information at our fingertips and yet most of us don’t know how the world really works. This book explains seven of the most fundamental realities governing our survival and prosperity. From energy and food production, through our material world and its globalization, to risks, our environment and its future, How the World Really Works offers a much-needed reality check—because before we can tackle problems effectively, we must understand the facts. In this ambitious and thought- provoking book we see, for example, that globalization isn’t inevitable—the foolishness of allowing 70 per cent of the world’s rubber gloves to be made in just one factory became glaringly obvious in 2020—and that our societies have been steadily increasing their dependence on fossil fuels, such that any promises of decarbonization by 2050 are a fairy tale. For example, each greenhouse-grown supermarket-bought tomato has the equivalent of five tablespoons of diesel embedded in its production, and we have no way of producing steel, cement or plastics at required scales without huge carbon emissions. Ultimately, Smil answers the most profound question of our age: are we irrevocably doomed or is a brighter utopia ahead? Compelling, data- rich and revisionist, this wonderfully broad, interdisciplinary guide finds faults with both extremes. Looking at the world through this quantitative lens reveals hidden truths that change the way we see our past, present and uncertain future."

He enters the forest, spellbound by the beauty of the Canadian wilderness, and suddenly hears the notes of a violin echoing in an airship terminal—an experience that shocks him to his core. Two centuries later a famous writer named Olive Llewellyn is on a book tour. She’s traveling all over Earth, but her home is the second moon colony, a place of white stone, spired towers, and artificial beauty. Within the text of Olive’s best-selling pandemic novel lies a strange passage: a man plays his violin for change in the echoing corridor of an airship terminal as the trees of a forest rise around him. When Gaspery-Jacques Roberts, a detective in the black-skied Night City, is hired to investigate an anomaly in the North American wilderness, he uncovers a series of lives upended: The exiled son of an earl driven to madness, a writer trapped far from home as a pandemic ravages Earth, and a childhood friend from the Night City who, like Gaspery himself, has glimpsed the chance to do something extraordinary that will disrupt the timeline of the universe. A virtuoso performance that is as human and tender as it is intellectually playful, Sea of Tranquility is a novel of time travel and metaphysics that precisely captures the reality of our current moment.”"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Notes from Underground by Fyodor Dostoevsky\n\n\nisbn-13: 9780802845702\nAudible\n\nAI Generated Content\n\n\nGenerated by gemini-3-pro-preview\n\n\n\nImage generated by gemini-3-pro-image-preview in the style of XKCD - with apologies to Randall Munroe\n\n\nPublished in 1864, Notes from Underground stands as a seminal work in the canon of existentialist literature and serves as a prelude to Fyodor Dostoevsky’s later, larger novels. The edition identified by ISBN 9780802845702 typically refers to the translation by Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky, which preserves the jagged, erratic, and distinctive voice of the protagonist. The novella is structured as a fictional memoir written by a retired civil servant living in St. Petersburg. Known only as the “Underground Man,” this narrator is an unnamed, forty-year-old anti-hero who represents a radical rejection of the rationalism and utopian socialism prevalent in mid-19th-century Russia.\nThe narrative is strictly divided into two sections: “Underground” and “Apropos of the Wet Snow.” The first part serves as a philosophical monologue in which the narrator introduces his worldview. He famously opens with the declaration, “I am a sick man… I am a spiteful man. I am an unpleasant man. I think my liver is diseased.” He refuses medical treatment out of sheer spite, establishing immediately that his actions are not governed by logic or self-interest, but by a chaotic need to assert agency.\nIn “Underground,” the narrator attacks the concept of “rational egoism” and the idea of the “Crystal Palace”—a metaphor for a utopian society founded on reason and mathematical precision, derived from Nikolay Chernyshevsky’s novel What Is to Be Done?. The Underground Man argues that a perfectly rational world reduces human beings to “piano keys” or “organ stops,” functioning only according to the laws of nature. He posits that humanity values free will above happiness or material advantage. To the Underground Man, the “stone wall” of scientific determinism (symbolized by the equation 2 x 2 = 4) is an insult to human consciousness. He states, “Twice two makes four seems to me simply a piece of insolence. Twice two makes four is a pert coxcomb who stands with arms akimbo barring your path and spitting.” He concludes that man would deliberately choose chaos and destruction simply to prove he is not a gear in a machine.\nThe second part, “Apropos of the Wet Snow,” shifts from philosophy to narrative, recounting events from sixteen years prior when the narrator was twenty-four. This section serves as a practical demonstration of the theories espoused in Part I. The narrative follows the Underground Man through a series of humiliating social interactions. He obsesses over an officer who physically moves him out of the way in a tavern, treating him as if he were an inanimate object. The narrator spends weeks plotting a “revenge” that consists merely of bumping into the officer on the Nevsky Prospect, an act that goes largely unnoticed by the officer but which the narrator views as a moral victory.\nFollowing this, the narrator invites himself to a farewell dinner for Zverkov, an old school acquaintance whom he loathes for his success and popularity. At the dinner, the Underground Man behaves erratically, insults the guests, paces the room, and drinks excessively, resulting in total social ostracization. In a drunken rage, he pursues the group to a brothel, intending to slap Zverkov, but finds them gone. Instead, he encounters Liza, a young prostitute.\nThe interaction with Liza forms the emotional climax of the book. The Underground Man manipulates Liza by describing a grim, hopeless future for her, employing sentimental rhetoric to break her spirit and make her realize her degradation. He succeeds in reducing her to tears, posing as her potential savior before leaving her his address. When Liza visits his apartment days later, expecting the heroic figure he pretended to be, she finds him in a state of poverty and domestic squalor. Ashamed and enraged, he lashes out at her, confessing that his previous kindness was merely a power trip designed to humiliate her to compensate for his own humiliation at the dinner. He tells her, “I had been humiliated, so I wanted to humiliate; I had been treated like a rag, so I wanted to show my power.” Despite his cruelty, Liza responds with compassion. Unable to accept this genuine connection, he thrusts money into her hand—treating her strictly as a prostitute—and she flees. He later finds she threw the money away. The memoir ends with the narrator noting that he has continued writing these notes for years, but the “editors” of the manuscript choose to cut the text off there, determining that enough has been said.\nThe character development of the Underground Man is characterized by a paradox: he is static in his inertia but volatile in his emotions. He defines himself by his “hyper-consciousness,” which he views as a disease. This acute awareness paralyzes him; he cannot become a hero or an insect, a scoundrel or an honest man. He is trapped in a cycle of self-loathing and superiority. He views himself as more intelligent than the “men of action” who surround him, yet he envies their stupidity because it allows them to live and act decisively. His development is a regression into deeper isolation; the flashback in Part II shows he once attempted social contact, while the narrator of Part I has fully retreated into his “corner.”\nThe central theme of the text is the conflict between free will and determinism. Dostoevsky utilizes the Underground Man to explore the consequences of a purely materialist worldview. If science can explain every human action, then moral responsibility ceases to exist. The Underground Man rebels against this by championing suffering. He argues that suffering is the sole origin of consciousness and that removing it—as utopian rationalists propose—would dehumanize society. “I agree that two times two makes four is an excellent thing; but if we are going to praise everything, then two times two makes five is sometimes also a very charming little thing.”\nAnother prevalent theme is the artificiality of the Russian intelligentsia of the time, whom Dostoevsky critiques for being disconnected from “living life.” The Underground Man admits he is a “bookish” man, unable to interact with reality without filtering it through literature and European philosophy. His tragedy lies in his inability to love or connect with another human being (Liza) because he views relationships only as a struggle for dominance. The book ultimately presents a critique of reason disconnected from moral and spiritual grounding, suggesting that total freedom without faith or love leads only to inertia and spite."

I had read It’s Your Ship some years earlier, and re-read it after reading Turn the Ship Around. Both books provide the same general message - that of empowering your team to make decisions and take the initiative. Both contained entertaining stories about the ups and downs - pun intended! - of naval life. Although I enjoyed reading both, I think Turn the Ship Around has more useful takeaways.\nMarquet’s book details his transformation from the traditional ‘Leader-Follower’ model typically seen in the navy as well as in business, where the leader gives the orders and his or her followers carry them out, to a ‘Leader-Leader’ model where followers are empowered to make decisions about how to carry out the leader’s intent. This manifested itself in the crew of the USS Santa Fe moving from asking permission from a superior to carry out an action (“Permission to …., Sir?” - “Permission granted”) to one of declaring intent (“I intend to …, Sir” - “Very well”). The difference being that the former transfers responsibility to the leader who is giving the order, whereas the latter shifts ownership of the action to the person carrying it out."

But the head of Slough House, the irascible Jackson Lamb, is convinced Dickie Bow was murdered.

The human population has been subjugated, with many forced to toil in mines to feed the alien war machine.\nThe narrative follows Ezra Barker, a man who has secured a relatively comfortable existence by working for the invaders. While most of humanity suffers, Ezra holds an office job within the puppet government, assisting “The Senator,” a human ruler appointed by the aliens to manage the territory. Ezra’s life is one of administrative complicity; he helps manage the logistics of the occupation, ensuring the resource extraction continues smoothly. However, the fragile safety of the collaborators is threatened by a persistent human resistance movement that refuses to surrender, as well as the inherent brutality of the Merg themselves."

His character study focuses on the justifications one makes to survive.\nThe Senator is a powerful human figure appointed by The Merg. She governs a specific territory, acting as the intermediary between the alien strip-miners and the oppressed human population. She embodies the political aspect of collaboration, wielding power granted by the enemy.\nSergeant Hayes serves as an enforcer for the collaborationist regime. Working for the “Health and Safety Department,” Hayes is responsible for policing the human population, executing the will of the Merg through arrests and violence. He represents the physical arm of the betrayal.\nThe Merg are the alien antagonists, depicted not just as conquerors but as a consuming force. They are indifferent to human life, viewing Earth solely as a resource to be harvested until nothing remains."

It challenges the reader to consider what they would do in an unwinnable situation: die a hero or survive as a traitor. The story examines the psychological toll of collaboration and the hatred directed at those who “sell out” their own kind.\nBureaucracy of Tyranny is another significant theme. The novel satirizes the administrative side of the apocalypse, showing how paperwork, office politics, and “Health and Safety” departments can facilitate planetary destruction and mass oppression.\nEnvironmental Devastation serves as the backdrop for the narrative. The description of the gray skies and poisonous air highlights the total consumption of the natural world by the alien industrial machine, reflecting anxieties about resource depletion and environmental collapse."

He’s the narrator in the Audiobook version and like his last book Talking to Strangers he does a great job.\nA key difference between this book and his previous books is that Gladwell doesn’t have a central thesis that he tries to argue by threading together different stories. This is more of a linear telling of history, albeit with his usual cast of many characters.\nPublisher’s Description: “An exploration of how technology and best intentions collide in the heat of war In The Bomber Mafia, Malcolm Gladwell weaves together the stories of a Dutch genius and his homemade computer, a band of brothers in central Alabama, a British psychopath, and pyromaniacal chemists at Harvard to examine one of the greatest moral challenges in modern American history. Most military thinkers in the years leading up to World War II saw the airplane as an afterthought. But a small band of idealistic strategists had a different view. This”Bomber Mafia” asked: What if precision bombing could, just by taking out critical choke points–industrial or transportation hubs–cripple the enemy and make war far less lethal? In his podcast, Revisionist History, Gladwell reexamines moments from the past and asks whether we got it right the first time. In The Bomber Mafia, he steps back from the bombing of Tokyo on the deadliest night of the war and asks, “Was it worth it?” The attack was the brainchild of General Curtis LeMay, whose brutal pragmatism and scorched-earth tactics in Japan cost tens of thousands of civilian lives, but may have spared more by averting a planned US invasion. Things might have gone differently had LeMay’s predecessor, General Haywood Hansell, remained in charge. As a key member of the Bomber Mafia, Hansell believed in precision bombing, but his theories had been foiled by bad weather, enemy jet fighters, and human error. When he and Curtis LeMay squared off for a leadership handover in the jungles of Guam, LeMay emerged victorious, leading to the darkest night of World War II. The Bomber Mafia is a riveting tale of persistence, innovation, and the incalculable wages of war.”"

    "text": "Meditations by Marcus Aurelius\n\n\nI’ve seen this book recommended many times by different people. I ended up getting the audiobook on Audible and backed it up with a Kindle version. The eBook is the Dover Thrift Edition - a modernized version of the George Long translation. I’m not entirely sure which translation is used in the audiobook. The narrator is pretty good but I found the density of the prose in the book required a level of concentration not typical when listening to audiobooks. There are a lot of ideas presented in the book requiring contemplation, but if you even briefly get distracted by your contemplations the audiobook has moved on. I think this why I generally prefer listen to fiction on audiobook rather than non-fiction, though I find history also seems to work well on audiobook.\nAs to Meditations, I understand now why so many have recommended this book. Marcus Aurelius was a Roman Emperor who ascended to the throne in 161 AD. This book contains his reflections on life and how to live it, based on the precepts of Stoicism, of which Aurelius was a disciple. Meditations is actually made of up 12 books. The first book is a list of people who have influenced his life and what he learnt from each. I found this to be very profound - the idea that there is something to be learnt from everyone that you interact with. It certainly got me thinking about the people who have influenced me and what I learnt from them - something I would like to put in to writing at some point in my life. The rest of the books are a series of meditations on various aspects of life. On first study, I couldn’t easily discern specific themes for each book though. This is a book to return to multiple times. I have read that the 2002 translation by Gregory Hays is more easily digestible, others recommend the 1964 transation by Maxwell Staniforth . There definitely seems to be a lot of variability between translations. I really liked the Stoic philosophy as presented in Meditations - I find a lot of congruence between it and the fundamental teachings of Islam, with one or two basic differences. The Serenity Prayer:\n\nGod, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, Courage to change the things I can, And wisdom to know the difference.\n\ncould easily be a succinct encapsulation of the philosophy presented in Meditations.\nA random quote from Meditations - Book VII, line 54:\n\nEverywhere and at all times it is in your power piously to acquiesce in your present condition, and to behave justly to those around you, and to exert your skill upon your present thoughts, that nothing shall steal into them without being well examined."

Published with the insight of an author who understands the authentic tradecraft of modern espionage, the novel moves between the streets of Damascus and Paris. It tells the story of a high-stakes intelligence operation where the lines between professional duty and personal emotion blur dangerously. The book is widely praised for its realistic depiction of spycraft, moving beyond Hollywood tropes to show the gritty, anxious reality of operating in a hostile surveillance state [2]."

The operation ends in tragedy when Sam’s colleague and close friend, Valerie Owens, is captured and killed by the Syrian regime. Driven by a desire for justice, Sam is redeployed to Paris to recruit Mariam Haddad, a Syrian palace official with access to the inner circle of the Assad regime. Mariam, a member of the privileged Christian minority, is disillusioned by the government’s brutality against its own people [1].\nSam successfully recruits Mariam, but their relationship soon violates the golden rule of intelligence work: they fall in love. As Mariam returns to Damascus to gather intelligence, she uncovers a terrifying plot by Rustum Hassan, the head of the Republican Guard, to unleash Sarin gas on the Syrian population. The story evolves into a tense cat-and-mouse game as Sam and Mariam try to stop the attack while evading Ali Hassan, the brilliant and ruthless head of Syrian counter-intelligence who is hunting for the mole within the palace [3]."

She is a complex figure, balancing her fear of the regime with her desire to save her country.\nAli Hassan: The head of Syrian internal security.

He is a formidable adversary who believes he is holding his country together against chaos [2].\nRustum Hassan: The brother of Ali and head of the Republican Guard.

The tension often comes from the mundane but deadly serious necessity of following protocol [2].\nForbidden Love is a central theme that raises the stakes of the narrative. The relationship between Sam and Mariam is not just a subplot but a driving force that complicates every decision. It explores the human cost of a profession that demands absolute emotional detachment.\nThe book also delves into Loyalty and Betrayal. Mariam’s arc highlights the moral ambiguity of the Syrian conflict, showing the difficult choices faced by minorities who fear the extremists but despise the regime’s cruelty. It questions what it means to be a patriot when the state has turned against its citizens [3]."

Money—investing, personal finance, and business decisions—is typically taught as a math-based field, where data and formulas tell us exactly what to do. But in the real world people don’t make financial decisions on a spreadsheet. They make them at the dinner table, or in a meeting room, where personal history, your own unique view of the world, ego, pride, marketing, and odd incentives are scrambled together. In The Psychology of Money, award-winning author Morgan Housel shares 19 short stories exploring the strange ways people think about money and teaches you how to make better sense of one of life’s most important topics.”"

In fact, I specifically chose that particular routing so that I would drive by Einstein’s house.\nThe premise of this book is that after World War II Albert Einstein would invite philosopher and (sometime) pacifist, Bertrand Russell, quantum physicist, Wolfgang Pauli and the brilliant logician, Kurt Gödel to his house to discuss science and philosophy. I bought the book under the impression that it would uncover the secrets of what these great men discussed but the reality is that there’s is very little known about these meetings, if indeed the four were ever actually there at the same time. The only written record of these meetings comes from a passing remark in Russell’s Autobiography. Gödel claims to have only ever had one discussion with Russell.\nStill it’s a useful hook from which to hang biographies of each man as well as many of their contemporaries (especially Heisenberg and Oppenheimer) and the scientific milieu that each was a part of. It does bounce around a bit from topic to topic, and is not a substitute for a proper biography of each man.\nPublisher’s Description: “From the acclaimed author of The Nobel Prize comes this fascinating portrait of four of the greatest minds in the history of science and the impossible turning point they faced.”"

How did Fidel Castro fool the CIA for a generation? Why did Neville Chamberlain think he could trust Adolf Hitler? Why are campus sexual assaults on the rise? Do television sitcoms teach us something about the way we relate to each other that isn’t true? Talking to Strangers is a classically Gladwellian intellectual adventure, a challenging and controversial excursion through history, psychology, and scandals taken straight from the news. He revisits the deceptions of Bernie Madoff, the trial of Amanda Knox, the suicide of Sylvia Plath, the Jerry Sandusky pedophilia scandal at Penn State University, and the death of Sandra Bland—throwing our understanding of these and other stories into doubt. Something is very wrong, Gladwell argues, with the tools and strategies we use to make sense of people we don’t know. And because we don’t know how to talk to strangers, we are inviting conflict and misunderstanding in ways that have a profound effect on our lives and our world. In his first book since his #1 bestseller, David and Goliath, Malcolm Gladwell has written a gripping guidebook for troubled times.”"

    "text": "Dickens and Prince by Hornby Nick\n\n\nisbn-13: 9780593541821\nHardcover\nPublisher’s Description\n“An ardent fan letter from Hornby that makes you want to re-read Great Expectations while listening to Sign o’ the Times.” —Vogue From the bestselling author of Just Like You, High Fidelity, and Fever Pitch, a short, warm, and entertaining book about art, creativity, and the unlikely similarities between Victorian novelist Charles Dickens and modern American rock star Prince Every so often, a pairing comes along that seems completely unlikely—until it’s not. Peanut butter and jelly, Dennis Rodman and Kim Jong Un, ducks and puppies, and now: Dickens and Prince. Equipped with a fan’s admiration and his trademark humor and wit, Nick Hornby invites us into his latest obsession: the cosmic link between two unlikely artists, geniuses in their own rights, spanning race, class, and centuries—each of whom electrified their different disciplines and whose legacy resounded far beyond their own time. When Prince’s 1987 record Sign o’ the Times was rereleased in “2020”, the iconic album now came with dozens of songs that weren’t on the original— Prince was endlessly prolific, recording 102 songs in 1986 alone. In awe, Hornby began to wonder, Who else ever produced this much? Who else ever worked that way? He soon found his answer in Victorian novelist and social critic Charles Dickens, who died more than a hundred years before Prince began making music. Examining the two artists’ personal tragedies, social statuses, boundless productivity, and other parallels, both humorous and haunting, Hornby shows how these two unlikely men from different centuries “lit up the world.” In the process, he creates a lively, stimulating rumination on the creativity, flamboyance, discipline, and soul it takes to produce great art."

    "section": "Introduction",
    "text": "Introduction\n“The Next Conversation: Argue Less, Talk More” by Jefferson Fisher serves as a practical guide for navigating high-stakes and everyday interactions with the goal of reducing conflict and fostering genuine connection. Drawing on his background as a trial lawyer, Fisher challenges the conventional wisdom that conversations are battles to be won. He argues that the desire to “win” an argument often comes at the expense of the relationship, a cost that is rarely worth paying [1]. Instead, the book proposes a shift in perspective: effective communication is not about conquering an opponent but about self-regulation and intentionality.\nThe book is structured to help readers transform how they speak by first transforming how they think and feel during an interaction. Fisher provides actionable advice on how to maintain composure, speak with authority without aggression, and ultimately build bridges rather than burn them. It is a manual for those who wish to move from reactive arguments to proactive, meaningful dialogue."

    "section": "Overview of the Key Points",
    "text": "Overview of the Key Points\nThe core of Fisher’s methodology is built around a three-part framework known as the “Three Cs”: Control, Confidence, and Connection. Each section offers specific tools to handle difficult conversations.\n\nSay it with Control\nThe first step in any difficult conversation is mastering one’s own internal state. Fisher emphasizes “Pause Power,” advising readers to take a 5-10 second pause before responding to heated comments. This brief interval allows for the nervous system to settle, preventing reactive outbursts [1]. He also advocates for using breath as the first word—stabilizing oneself physically before engaging verbally. Another critical technique is labeling emotions, such as admitting “I am feeling defensive,” which helps to manage feelings rather than letting them dictate the course of the discussion [1].\n\n\nSay it with Confidence\nOnce control is established, the focus shifts to delivery. Fisher suggests replacing accusatory language with assertive vulnerability. This involves shifting from “You” statements (e.g., “You never listen”) to “I” statements (e.g., “I feel unheard”), which significantly reduces defensiveness in the other party [1]. To sound more authoritative, he advises eliminating filler words like “just,” “kind of,” or “I guess.” Additionally, the “No” Framework provides a method to decline requests clearly and kindly by being direct, showing gratitude, and maintaining a kind tone [1].\n\n\nSay it to Connect\nThe ultimate objective is connection. Fisher encourages a mindset of listening to understand rather than listening to respond [3]. He borrows the “Yes, And” approach from improv comedy to build upon ideas rather than shutting them down with “but.” When faced with insults or rude behavior, he suggests asking questions of intent rather than reacting to the content of the insult, and using the phrase “I see it differently” instead of “I disagree” to keep the dialogue open [1]."

    "text": "Overview of the Key Themes\n\nEmpathy Over Ego\nA recurring theme throughout the book is the suppression of the ego. Fisher posits that the need to be “right” is the enemy of connection. He urges readers to prioritize the health of the relationship over the momentary satisfaction of winning a debate [1].\n\n\nEmotional Regulation\nThe book treats effective communication as an inside-out process. Fisher argues that while we cannot control what others say or do, we have absolute agency over our own reactions. Emotional regulation is portrayed not just as a coping mechanism, but as a strategic advantage in communication [3].\n\n\nIntentionality and Boundaries\nEvery word matters in Fisher’s framework. He promotes being deliberate with tone and word choice, ensuring that the message received matches the intent [2]. Furthermore, setting boundaries is reframed not as an act of hostility, but as providing an “operator’s manual” for how one expects to be treated, which is essential for healthy long-term communication [1]."

Jefferson Fisher combines the tactical precision of a trial lawyer with the empathetic insight of a mediator to create a guide that is both strategic and humane. By mastering the “Three Cs”—Control, Confidence, and Connection—readers are equipped to handle even the most volatile conversations with grace. The book ultimately teaches that the most powerful argument is not the one that defeats an opponent, but the one that preserves the relationship."

In this controversial and exciting listen, Pollan explores caffeine’s power as the most-used drug in the world—and the only one we give to children (in soda pop) as a treat.\nPollan takes us on a journey through the history of the drug, which was first discovered in a small part of East Africa and within a century became an addiction affecting most of the human species. Caffeine, it turns out, has changed the course of human history—won and lost wars, changed politics, dominated economies. What’s more, the author shows that the Industrial Revolution would have been impossible without it. The science of how the drug has evolved to addict us is no less fascinating. And caffeine has done all these things while hiding in plain sight! Percolated with Michael Pollan’s unique ability to entertain, inform, and perform, Caffeine is essential listening in a world where an estimated two billion cups of coffee are consumed every day.”"

Monsters’ hoards are claimed, bought by corporate interests, and sold off to plunder funds long before the Heroes’ Guild actually kills the beasts. Of course, that’s a terrible arrangement for the Shadowkin; Orcs, Goblins, Kobolds, and their ilk must apply for to become Noncombatant Paper Carriers (or NPCs) to avoid being killed and looted by heroes.When Gorm Ingerson, a Dwarven ex-hero with a checkered past, stands up for an undocumented Goblin, he inadvertently singles himself out for recruitment by a prophet of the mad goddess to undertake a suicidal quest. But there’s more to Gorm’s new job than an insane prophecy: powerful corporations and governments have shown an unusual interest in the quest. If his party of eccentric misfits can stop fighting each other long enough to recover the Elven Marbles, Gorm might be able to turn a bad deal into a golden opportunity.”"

Perhaps it was because the first two were mysteries of a sort whereas this is more of a family drama. There is a mystery to be revealed here as well, but it’s all reasonably predictable.\nPublisher’s Description: “In this”compelling, bighearted, emotionally precise page-turner” (Sunday Times), the New York Times bestselling writer and acclaimed television host explores the aftermath of a tragedy on a small-town to illuminate the shame and longing that can flow through generations–and how the secrets of the heart cannot stay be buried forever. It is 1987 and a small Irish community is preparing for a wedding. The day before the ceremony, a group of young friends, including the bride and groom, are involved in an accident. Three survive. Three are killed. The lives of the families are shattered and the rifts between them ripple throughout the small town. Connor survived, but living among the angry and the mourning is almost as hard as carrying the shame of having been the driver. He leaves the only place he knows for another life, taking his secrets with him. Travelling first to Liverpool, then London, he eventually makes a home–of sorts–for himself in New York, where he finds shelter and the possibility of forging a new life. But the secrets–the unspoken longings and regrets that have come to haunt those left behind–will not be silenced. Before long, Connor will have to confront his past. A powerful and timely novel of emigration and return, Home Stretch demonstrates Norton’s keen understanding of the power of stigma and secrecy–and their devastating effect on ordinary lives.”"

Why is Miami…Miami? What does the heartbreaking fate of the cheetah tell us about the way we raise our children? Why do Ivy League schools care so much about sports? What is the Magic Third, and what does it mean for racial harmony? In this provocative new work, Malcolm Gladwell returns for the first time in twenty-five years to the subject of social epidemics and tipping points, this time with the aim of explaining the dark side of contagious phenomena. Through a series of riveting stories, Gladwell traces the rise of a new and troubling form of social engineering. He takes us to the streets of Los Angeles to meet the world’s most successful bank robbers, rediscovers a forgotten television show from the 1970s that changed the world, visits the site of a historic experiment on a tiny cul- de-sac in northern California, and offers an alternate history of two of the biggest epidemics of our day: COVID and the opioid crisis. Revenge of the Tipping Point is Gladwell’s most personal book yet. With his characteristic mix of storytelling and social science, he offers a guide to making sense of the contagions of modern world.

Then, in the summer of “2020”, he’s assigned to a grotesque murder case that brings national media focus to rural Patrick County, Virginia–Alicia Benson, the wife of a wealthy businessman, is murdered in her home. The accused killer, Damian Bullins, is a cunning felon with a long history of violence, and he confesses to the police. He even admits his guilt to Andy. But a simple typographical error and a shocking discovery begin to complicate the state’s case, making it possible Bullins might escape punishment. Duty- bound to give his client a thorough defense, Andy–despite his misgivings– agrees to fight for a not-guilty verdict, a decision that will ultimately force him to make profound, life-and-death choices, both inside and outside the courtroom. With its unforgettable characters, insider’s blueprint of the justice system, intricate plotting, and provocative, no-holds-barred ending, The Plinko Bounce demonstrates once again why Martin Clark has been called “the thinking man’s John Grisham” by The New York Times and praised as “hands down, our finest legal-thriller writer” by Entertainment Weekly."

In 1942, Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse - mathematical genius and young Captain in the U.S. Navy - is assigned to detachment 2702. It is an outfit so secret that only a handful of people know it exists, and some of those people have names like Churchill and Roosevelt. The mission of Watrehouse and Detatchment 2702-commanded by Marine Raider Bobby Shaftoe-is to keep the Nazis ignorant of the fact that Allied Intelligence has cracked the enemy’s fabled Enigma code. It is a game, a cryptographic chess match between Waterhouse and his German counterpart, translated into action by the gung-ho Shaftoe and his forces. Fast-forward to the present, where Waterhouse’s crypto-hacker grandson, Randy, is attempting to create a”data haven” in Southeast Asia - a place where encrypted data can be stored and exchanged free of repression and scrutiny. As governments and multinationals attack the endeavor, Randy joins forces with Shaftoe’s tough-as-nails grandaughter, Amy, to secretly salvage a sunken Nazi sumarine that holds the key to keeping the dream of a data haven afloat. But soon their scheme brings to light a massive conspiracy with its roots in Detachment 2702 linked to an unbreakable Nazi code called Arethusa. And it will represent the path to unimaginable riches and a future of personal and digital liberty…or to universal totalitarianism reborn. A breathtaking tour de force, and Neal Stephenson’s most accomplished and affecting work to date, CRYPTONOMICON is profound and prophetic, hypnotic and hyper-driven, as it leaps forward and back between World War II and the World Wide Web, hinting all the while at a dark day- after-tomorrow. It is a work of great art, thought, and creative daring; the product of a truly icon”"

London: Slough House is the MI5 branch where disgraced operatives are reassigned after they’ve messed up too badly to be trusted with real intelligence work. The “Slow Horses,” as the failed spies of Slough House are called, are doomed to spend the rest of their careers pushing paper, but they all want back in on the action. When one of their own is kidnapped and held for ransom, the agents of Slough House must defeat the odds, overturning all expectations of their competence, to breach the top-notch security of MI5’s intelligence headquarters, Regent’s Park, and steal valuable intel in exchange for their comrade’s safety. The kidnapping is only the tip of the iceberg, however—the agents uncover a larger web of intrigue that involves not only a group of private mercenaries but the highest authorities in the Secret Service. After years spent as the lowest on the totem pole, the Slow Horses suddenly find themselves caught in the midst of a conspiracy that threatens not only the future of Slough House, but of MI5 itself."

For backward compatibility, a new field can be added so long as it is optional - otherwise new code reading old data will not find the new required field. When removing a field, to maintain both forward and backward compatibility, the removed field must be optional (and you can’t use the same field tag again).\nAvro handles schema evolution by storing the writer’s schema in the file. When code with a new schema reads the file, it can compare the new schema with the old schema in the file. To maintain compatibility, only fields with a default value can be added or removed."

Almost everything I “read” in the second half of 2020 was actually an audiobook, the only exceptions being The Holy Quran and Malfuzat which were hardcovers.\nDavid Quammen produced probably the most memorable read of the second half of the year (as he did the first half with Spillover) in The Reluctant Mr. Darwin. Not a complete biography of Darwin as it only covers his life after his adventures on the HMS Beagle, but it helps put the theory of evolution in proper historical context. I certainly learn a lot from it.\nThe Hate U Give was a timely read given the events of the summer with the Black Lives Matter movement. Although categorized as a “young adult” novel this far-from-young adult found it enjoyable and thought-provoking.\nOrconomics and its follow-up Son Of A Liche were my first forays into LitRPG. Never having played D&D or its ilk, I wasn’t up to speed with all the conventions of the genre - nevertheless I found both books enjoyable and funny. While following the typical fantasy story conventions the books are also an effective satire on capitalism , modern day finance and the housing crash (Collateralized Threat Obligations play a big role in the plot of the second book!)\nStorm Front was a strong recommendation from a friend - a combination of mystery and magical fantasy. While I enjoyed it, the opportunity costs involved mean I will probably skip investing time into the remaining 16+ novels in the series (at least for now).\nOn the non-fiction front Think Like a Rocket Scientist and Workplace Poker were useful but not essential reads, while An Economist Walks Into A Brother was disappointing."

    "section": "",
    "text": "I used LLMs to generate summaries and visuals for every book I read this year, largely replacing a task I usually procrastinate on and batch at year-end.\nThe models did a genuinely good job on well-known books, but struggled noticeably with more obscure titles that were likely outside their training data.\nAn agent-based approach overcame the shortcomings of single-shot prompts and eliminated hallucinations.\nThe visuals were the standout: infographics and comic strips were consistently impressive.\nOverall, this felt less like automation for its own sake and more like a practical, time-saving use of AI — just make sure to review the output!\n\n\n\n\nNano Banana Pro generated image summarizing this article with a comic in the style of Judge Dredd\n\n\nEvery year around this time, I begin working on my blog post summarizing the books I’ve read over the past twelve months. To help with this, I create a summary page for every book I read — for example, here’s one I did earlier this year for Nate Silver’s “On the Edge”. The original idea was to note some key points and takeaways for each so I can review them later and remind myself about any important lessons or key quotes for the book. I have a script that generates a basic outline page for each book, to which I can also add my own notes. In practice, though, I rarely create the page or add notes right after reading. Instead, I end up doing them all in bulk at the end of the year. At that point, each page typically just has the skeleton info or perhaps some perfunctory comments from me.\nThis year I decided to use AI to summarize each book. I was also impressed with what I’d seen from Google’s Nano Banana Pro model, so I used it to generate visuals for each book: infographics for non-fiction and comic strips for fiction. You can see the prompts I used for the summaries here (non-fiction) and here (fiction). In addition, the prompts used for the visuals can be seen here (infographic) and here (comic strip). I decided to use Google’s Gemini 3 Pro (gemini-3-pro-preview) for the summary generation and Nano Banana Pro (gemini-3-pro-image-preview) for the visualizations.\n\n\nExamples:\n\n\n\n“Animal Societies”\n\n\n\n\n\n“The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes”\n\n\nFor most books, Google’s LLM produced solid summaries, and the visuals were particularly impressive. When generating comic strips, I asked the model to mimic xkcd’s style, and both the images and tone felt appropriate. The infographics were excellent, with very few spelling mistakes. That said, I would prefer a less dramatic visual style and could likely get even better results with more prompt refinement.\nHowever, for a small number of the fiction books, the LLM came back with a summary that only had a cursory relationship with the actual plot of the book.

    "section": "",
    "text": "I used LLMs to generate summaries and visuals for every book I read this year, largely replacing a task I usually procrastinate on and batch at year-end.\nThe models did a genuinely good job on well-known books, but struggled noticeably with more obscure titles that were likely outside their training data.\nAn agent-based approach overcame the shortcomings of single-shot prompts and eliminated hallucinations.\nThe visuals were the standout: infographics and comic strips were consistently impressive.\nOverall, this felt less like automation for its own sake and more like a practical, time-saving use of AI — just make sure to review the output!\n\n\n\n\nNano Banana Pro generated image summarizing this article with a comic in the style of Judge Dredd\n\n\nEvery year around this time, I begin working on my blog post summarizing the books I’ve read over the past twelve months. To help with this, I create a summary page for every book I read — for example, here’s one I did earlier this year for Nate Silver’s “On the Edge”. The original idea was to note some key points and takeaways for each so I can review them later and remind myself about any important lessons or key quotes for the book. I have a script that generates a basic outline page for each book, to which I can also add my own notes. In practice, though, I rarely create the page or add notes right after reading. Instead, I end up doing them all in bulk at the end of the year. At that point, each page typically just has the skeleton info or perhaps some perfunctory comments from me.\nThis year I decided to use AI to summarize each book. I was also impressed with what I’d seen from Google’s Nano Banana Pro model, so I used it to generate visuals for each book: infographics for non-fiction and comic strips for fiction. You can see the prompts I used for the summaries here (non-fiction) and here (fiction). In addition, the prompts used for the visuals can be seen here (infographic) and here (comic strip). I decided to use Google’s Gemini 3 Pro (gemini-3-pro-preview) for the summary generation and Nano Banana Pro (gemini-3-pro-image-preview) for the visualizations.\n\n\nExamples:\n\n\n\n“Animal Societies”\n\n\n\n\n\n“The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes”\n\n\nFor most books, Google’s LLM produced solid summaries, and the visuals were particularly impressive. When generating comic strips, I asked the model to mimic xkcd’s style, and both the images and tone felt appropriate. The infographics were excellent, with very few spelling mistakes. That said, I would prefer a less dramatic visual style and could likely get even better results with more prompt refinement.\nHowever, for a small number of the fiction books, the LLM came back with a summary that only had a cursory relationship with the actual plot of the book. A good example of this is the summary it produced of “A Reluctant Spy” by David Goodman. The summary it produced - you can read it here - was only vaguely similar to the novel’s plot. I requested the summary multiple times and each time it would get the first name of the main character (Jamie) correct but a different surname and completely made up names for the other main characters.

    "text": "Attention Is All You Need\nTwo of favorite books this year were about attention - why we can’t pay attention and what we should pay attention to in our limited time left on this planet. “Stolen Focus - Why You Can’t Pay Attention” by Johann Hari was a personal journey by journalist and author Johann Hari to recapture his stolen focus but also to undercover the wider forces at play in stealing our attention. Hari uncovers 12 causes for the attention crisis. A thought provoking book, though I found the more personal earlier chapters more appealing than the later ones where he talks about broader societal issues.\n“Four Thousand Weeks - Time Management for Mortals” by Oliver Burkeman has a potentially misleading title, especially if you’re reading it to find time saving tips and tricks. It’s a much more philosophical work that starts with the premise that an average 80-year life consists of about 4,000 weeks. If, like me, you’re well past the mid-point of the average life-span, thinking about the number of weeks you have left does make you ponder how much of that time should be spent doom-scrolling on social media or binge-watching a series on Netflix. Worth a read - pair with this blog post that lets you visualize the probability distribution of your remaining lifespan.\n\n\nHere’s mine:"

    "text": "We Can Work It Out\nOne topic I’ve been very interested in over the last few years is the idea of dialog and how personally and as a society we can discuss strongly held but opposing beliefs without it devolving into a shouting match (or silent seething). A number of books I read this year were on this or related topics. “The Righteous Mind - Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion” by pyschologist Jonathan Haidt was the ‘deepest’ of these books. It took me a while to read, not because the language was difficult but the concepts introduced deserved a lot of thought and digestion. Haidt covers the field of moral psychology and gives us a history of the different theories of how and why morals evolved drawing on research in neuroscience, genetics, social psychology and evolutionary modeling. As someone who leans liberal, I came away with a better understanding of why conservatives take the positions they do. Haidt has a distinctly secular view on religion and morals, which I don’t personally agree with, but his theories are worth trying to understand.\n\n\n\n“I Never Thought Of It That Way” by Monica Guzman is a much lighter read on a similar topic. It has a lot of anecdotes from the authors life with practical suggestions about bridging the divide with people who hold an opposing view. I enjoyed the book and came away with a bunch of practical (if not ground-breaking) tools.\nI read the first version of “Crucial Conversations: Tools for Talking When Stakes Are High” by Kerry Patterson many years ago and for some reasons it never made much of an impression (perhaps I was not mature enough at the time to understand the lessons from the book). This time around, I found this book full of practical and useful guidelines for approaching difficult conversations.\n“You’re Not Listening: What You’re Missing and Why It Matters” by Kate Murphy and “Conflicted: How Productive Disagreements Lead to Better Outcomes” by Ian Leslie were a couple of other books in this general area that I read - both were ok but essential reading."

A story of how an IRS agent managed to trace Bitcoin transactions around the globe and identify the real people behind various corners of the dark web. A great read. Pair this with “Number Go Up: Inside Crypto’s Wild Rise and Staggering Fall” by Zeke Faux which goes into depth about a cryptocurrency called Tether as well diving into the rise and fall of Sam Bankman Fried and FTX. If you have ever gotten random texts from strangers (usually someone purporting to be an attractive Asian female) who try and draw you into a conversation, read the chapter on “Pig Butchering” to understand what is actually going on.\n“Narconomics: How to Run a Drug Cartel” by Tom Wainwright was a fascinating insight into the economics of the drug trade. I learnt that relationship between drug cartels and the drug growers is similar to that between farmers and (say) Walmart and how focusing on eradicating a drug crop does little to harm the drug cartels and just increases the costs of the growers."

The book is emotional, raw and not easy to listen to in some places. She had a difficult life and went through much more trauma than I knew about before listening to her autobiography. She never saw herself as a star and rebelled against the trappings of the music industry. RIP Sinead O’Connor.\n\n\n\nSurrender is a much more “produced” affair, with music introducing each chapter and punctuating various parts of the book. Bono is definitely a polarizing figure and I’m sure some people would rather watch pain dry than listen to Bono pontificate. However, I have a soft spot for him and really enjoyed the book. There are a lot of intimate details of his early life, coping (or not) with the early death of his mother through to some of his wilder rock star moments. It’s a good example of how an audiobook can be much more than just a straighforward narration of a written book."

He focuses on data-driven analysis - his “How the World Really Works: The Science Behind How We Got Here and Where We’re Going” was facinating. The chapters on Understanding Energy provided a lot of interesting information about how our energy usage and sources have changed over time, highlighting the huge shift in kinetic energy coming from draft animals and humans to engines driven primarily by fossil fuels. The chapter on Understanding Our Material World provided insights on society’s reliance what Smil calls the ‘The Four Pillars of Modern Civilization’: Ammonia, Plastics, Steel and Concrete. The book provides a lot of data showing the difficulties of extricating ourselves from fossil fuels - a potentially depressing reality check.\n“Stuff Matters: Exploring the Marvelous Materials That Shape Our Man-Made World” by Mark Miodownik was an interesting companion read about common-place items and materials that we often take for granted: steel, paper, concrete, chocolate, foam, plastic, glass, graphite, porcelain and implants.\n“The Things We Make: The Unknown History of Invention from Cathedrals to Soda Cans” by Bill Hammack is a homage to engineers and the “engineering method”. Lots of interesting stories such as that of Hiram Maxim and his contributions to the creation of the electric bulb, or the invention of the microwave oven."

Before reading the book, my recollection was that it was a Shia uprising, a view that still seems to be commonly held. With the American Embassy being stormed in Tehran only weeks earlier, the US government assumed the Iranians were behind this attack and briefed the press accordingly. In fact this was very much a Sunni Salafi rebellion proclaiming the arrival of the awaited Mahdi. In the days before the Internet, mobile phones and social media the Saudi government was able to maintain an information blockade about the true nature and extent of the rebellion, which was eventually subdued with the help of French commandos but only after a large death toll. You can draw direct connections from this uprising to the assasination of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and the birth of Al-Qaeda.\nIf you’ve ever wondered why American towns and cities feel so different to their European counterparts, “Confessions of a Recovering Engineer: Transportation for a Strong Town” by Charles L. Marohn Jr. is a good place to start. Standard design practices adopted by traffic engineers have given supremacy to the car over the needs of humans. Highly recommended if you are interested in urban or transportation issues.\n“Discipline Is Destiny: The Power of Self-Control” by Ryan Holiday was a short and easy read with bite sized chapters. Holiday provides examples from various figures from both ancient and modern history to show the benefits of self-discipline and temperance.\n“Smart Brevity: The Power of Saying More With Less” by Jim Vandehei is best read in physical book form to get the full effect of its typography and visual design. Not super deep, but has plenty of actionable advice on how to succinctly but with impact."

    "text": "Fiction\n“Matterhorn” by Karl Marlantes came highly recommended by a colleague. It’s the story of a company of Marines in Vietnam, narrated by the young lieutenant who’s just been given charge of them. The author was a Marine in the Vietnam war and apprently wrote the book over a period of 35 years based on his personal experiences. I almost gave up on the book after the first couple of chapters which were not for the faint-hearted. I’m glad I didn’t, although the book continued to be grim, it was also a heartbreaking story about the futility of wat and about camaraderie and courage and sacrifice. This novel gave me a perspective and insight on what it was like to be a US soldier in Vietnam that I didn’t get from any of the numerous movies set during the Vietnam War.\n“The Making of Another Major Motion Picture” by Tom Hanks was basically a detailed explanation of how a movie is made and all the different behind-the-camera roles that are involved, wrapped up inside a novel. There’s no real plot - once you get past waiting for something dramatic to happen and just enjoy the journey, the book is quite enjoyable.\n“The Reading List” by Sara Nisha Adams was a story about the important of reading and the insights good novels can provide into relationships and the human condition.\nIn “The Midnight Library” by Matt Haig the library is more of a metaphor. Each book is an alternate life you might have lived. Being a fan of multiverse scenarios I enjoyed this book, although its not really a science fiction book, it just uses that conceipt as a way of showing the different paths a person could have taken and the consequences of those decisions.\nI read “The Night Agent” by Matthew Quirk before watching the Netflix series based on the book. Both are enjoyable - as is typical, the plot in the book is a bit more involved than the TV series.\n“Reamde” by Neal Stephenson was the longest book I “read” (well, listened to) this year. Although a lot of the technology it references is now a bit dated, as a whole the book still holds up well with lots of twists and turns that come to a satisfying conclusion."

    "text": "Strong Ties, Weak Ties and No Ties\nNow, LinkedIn gets a lot of criticism but the one thing I find it’s good for is keeping in touch with people that you have “weak ties” with, in particular former colleagues. I communicate with close friends (my “strong ties”) by calling or messaging them directly, but I typically don’t want to fill up my address book with contact details of people I worked with twenty years ago. Just trying to keep the details up to date would be a major effort. Instead I rely on LinkedIn to keep us connected.\nThe problem for me though was that mixed in with those strong and weak ties were a very large amount of “no ties” - people who had asked to be added to my network but never communicated with me again. There were a lot of those, and I wanted to focus on the people in my network that I actually knew. I quickly figured out that trying to work through my network using the LinkedIn website was a waste of time. The sorting and filtering tools are rudimentary and paging through the list of connections was slow and frustrating, especially if you had to start again from the beginning if the page refreshed for some reason.\nInstead I used the facility LinkedIn provides to download your data to get a list of my contacts in CSV format. I loaded these into Excel and annotated them into Known, Unknown and Not Sure."

    "text": "Message(s) in a bottle\nAfter this I went about sending an individualized message to each person in the “Known” category, filtering out those who I would typically contact by some means other than LinkedIn. There is no (easy) way to do this programmatically (which is probably a good thing!) so I created a few different template messages - e.g. one for people in the US referencing “Happy Holidays”, one for those in the UK referencing “Merry Christmas and Happy New Year” etc. I then went one by one through my spreadsheet, creating a new message for each person, copying in the template text and customizing it, sending and finally marking that person as contacted on the spreadsheet.\nThis took some time. Between December 22 and December 27 I sent 538 messages.\nThen something happened that took the wind from my sails."

    "text": "An unexpected and sad event\nI did have a morbid thought as I was sending out these messages, especially regarding those I had not been in touch with for many years: “I hope everyone is still alive”.\nThis background worry became shockingly true on December 28th, when I received an email from a mutual friend that my friend and boss for many years and across multiple companies, Andy Bishop, had passed away unexpectedly in his sleep over Christmas. He was the same age as me (within a few months) and had retired early to spend time with his family in Cornwall, far from the stress of life in London. I could write many pages on what a great guy Andy was and how much he will be missed by all those whom he interacted with. Instead let me direct you to a memorial page created by his colleagues at BP.\nAt that point I lost my appetite for sending out further season’s greetings and instead decided to leverage my contact list to pass on the sad news to everyone who I knew that had also worked with Andy. We had worked together at JP Morgan, Cygnifi and Bank of America so that list was over 100 people."

Only one person (my very first manager at JP Morgan) was curious enough to ask what had prompted me to reach out after so many years.\nSome sample responses:\n\n“Wow blast from the past. Wonderful to hear from you. Hope you are well and have a great holidays!”\n\n\n“Hi Mahmood, it is lovely to hear from you and all the best Xmas wishes to you and your family”\n\n\n“Thanks Mahmood. Very kind of you to send the message.”\n\n\n“Wow nice to hear from you! Happy Holidays to you too! 👍👍”\n\n\n“Thanks for thinking of me, and sending a short note!

    "title": "What I read in 2019",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I managed to read 36 books in 2019 - slightly off my target of 40, but not bad considering extenuating circumstances. For full disclosure, the total of 36 does include 5 ‘Audible Originals’ that are shorter than a typical book - and in some cases, a bit of a stretch to be called a book. On the other hand the longest book I ‘read’ - Cryptonomicon - was a whopping 1,139 pages / 42 hrs and 44 minutes listening time! The vast majority were audiobooks, but I have started reading physical books again rather than just e-books.\nFavorite non-fiction books that I read in 2019: The Half Has Never Been Told by Edward R. Baptist was an eye-opening account of slavery in the period between Independence and the Civil War. He shows in detail how capitalism and profit drove the slave trade, the systematic torture that produced ever increasing cotton yields and how US and European banks created financial instruments with slaves as the underlying collateral.\nEducated by Tara Westover deservedly made a lot of ‘Best of 2018’ book lists. It is a gripping and at times difficult-to-read memoir of a girl growing up in a survivalist Mormon family. Difficult because many of her experiences growing up are so harrowing. How she went from being (barely) home-schooled on an Idaho mountain-side to studying in Cambridge and Harvard is worth every minute you spend reading it.\nI loved Algorithms to Live By by Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths, especially as a software developer who studied Electrical Engineering rather than Computer Science and have never really got the grounding in Algorithms that CS majors have. This is in no way a dry text book but an enjoyable tour through different categories of algorithms and how they have relevance in every day life outside of a computer program.\nThinking in Systems: A Primer by Donnella Meadows was originally published in 2008 and was a Farnam Street blog recommendation. It’s starts off with the basics of systems’ modelling and feedback mechanisms. Again not a textbook, but an easy to read introduction to systems analysis and how to apply to it to real-world problems. Even though modeling feedback control systems was something I had done back in university, I still found this a valuable read.\nRebooting AI by Gary Marcus and Ernest Davis is a useful counterbalance to the current hyperbole around AI. The authors make a convincing argument that current machine learning methods, including deep learning, are not sufficient to achieve anything like true Artificial General Intelligence. What’s not so clear is what, if anything, will get us there - the authors argue for a renewed focus on understanding human cognition with a hybrid of current machine learning with symbolic inference based on knowledge-bases being the way forward.\nI approached Malcom Gladwell’s Talking To Strangers with some trepidation. He is a great storyteller and his books are always a pleasure to read, but the premise or theory underlying some of his previous books (e.g. Blink or Outliers) has often turned out to be somewhat flawed. His latest book doesn’t seem to have a (to my mind at least) controversial underlying theory, so hopefully will stand the test of time better. As an aside, this book seems to be an exception to the general rule that authors shouldn’t narrate their own books and in fact makes great use of the audiobook format, using actual recordings of interviews wherever possible.\nMichael Lewis is another great storyteller, and when I finally got around to listening to The Undoing Project I wasn’t disappointed. Maybe I’ll make another attempt at finishing Daniel Kahneman’s Thinking, Fast and Slow in 2020!\nFavorite fiction books that I read in 2019: In non-fiction, I really liked Recursion by Blake Crouch - I’m a sucker for anything time-travel related and this story was very well done I thought. I discovered Dervla McTiernan and her detective novels, The Ruin and The Scholar set in my hometown of Galway - she’s no Tana French, but writing is decent enough and the setting makes them compelling, at least for me. Continuing the Irish theme, A Keeper and Holding by Graham Norton were enjoyable. The premise of Redshirts by John Scalzi was very clever and enough to keep me interested through some strangely stilted language. I recommend Righteous and Wrecked by Joe Ide for fans of detective novels and, of course, Michael Connelly (The Night Fire) never fails to please\nIn it’s own category… I guess that strictly speaking it’s in the fiction category, but The Unicorn Project by Gene Kim is a compelling read for anyone working in software development, especially in an enterprise environment. The follow-up to the brilliant The Phoenix Project, the Unicorn Project is actually set during the same period as the earlier book and gives the Dev side of the DevOps, whereas the Phoenix Project’s viewpoint was more the Ops side."

By far the longest ‘book’ I read this year (probably the equivalent of five volumes of the actual Harry Potter Series). - A Place For Us: An immigrant story and a coming of age story that affected me strongly. - Red Notice: A whirlwind story of greed and corruption amongst the oligarchs and officials of post-communist Russia."

How We Change looked at the subject from a psychotherapists point of view. Better is about trying to make things better in the medical world. Mistakes Were Made (But Not By Me) was updated last year to add a chapter on the Trump phenomenon - a very interesting book about self-deception, cognitive dissonance and why people don’t change their mind even in the face of clear evidence. I also started How To Change but didn’t manage to finish it before the end of the year."

    "text": "My Favorite Non-Fiction Reads of 2022\n\nBoyd - The Fighter Pilot Who Changed The Art Of War by Robert Coram: John Boyd is probably up there in list of most influential Americans of the 20th Century that very few people have heard of. A great fighter pilot who then went on to design the F-15 and F-16 fighter aircraft and ended his career as a military theorist whose ideas the US successfully used in both Gulf Wars. Boyd was an iconoclast who continually found himself fighting the Air Force hierarchy. As well as in-depth biography of Boyd, the book also provides an eye-opening inside view of Military-Industrial complex that Eisenhower warned of. Boyd was deeply flawed in many ways but had a personal code of honor that guided him throughout his career. My favorite quote of Boyd’s from the book is:\n\n\n“If your boss demands loyalty, give him integrity. But if he demands integrity, then give him loyalty”\n\n\nBorn A Crime - Stories From A South African Childhood by Trevor Noah: This had gotten rave reviews when it first came out, and they were well-deserved. Trevor Noah is a huge success today, but he’s had a remarkable and difficult early life. Along with being his personal story, this is also a story of South Africa during and after the overturning of Apartheid. Noah lets the reader see what it was like growing up poor and black in South Africa but always showing the humanity of the people he came into contact with.\nFreezing Order - A True Story Of Money Laundering, Murder, And Surviving Vladimir Putin’s Wrath by Bill Browder: A follow up to Red Notice this time continuing the story through the American court system. Lots of amazing twists and turn as Browder tussles with Russia in the courts.\nNever Split The Difference - Negotiating As If Your Life Depended On It by Chris Voss: I thought this was going to be one of those “one-idea” books that litters the broad self-help genre, but actually it was both entertaining as well as full of very practical tips. I used some of the tips in a negotiation in 2022 to good effect :-)"

A number of good takeaways from this book - for me the primary one was to avoid binary classifications that inevitably become “them and us”.\nTalk Lean - Shorter Meetings. Quicker Results. Better Relations by Alan Palmer: Lot of useful tips in this book about how to use more precise language to get better results. Some of the examples feel very British but I think the advice is universal.\nLords Of Finance by Liaquat Ahamed: Fascinating account of the period after the First World War where many countries fell into recession and depression and the attempts of key central bankers to try and prevent that from happening but that often made things worse. I feel understand the role of central banks much better after reading this.\nAltitude Or Attitude - A Geeks’s Travel Log; San Francisco To Concordia-K2-Gondogoro La Of Pakistan by Ifti Mirza: This was gifted to me by the author who was a colleague at Meta (although we never met in person). The writing could do with some editing, but the story is an unexpectedly thrilling account of getting to the K2 basecamp and back. I have no particular interest in climbing and I really enjoyed this book, so if you have a passion for climbing I’m sure you’ll love it. It made me realize this particular trip is something I will never want to subject myself to!\nThe 6 Types Of Working Genius - A Better Way To Understand Your Gifts, Your Frustrations, And Your Team by Patrick M. Lencioni: I’m a fan of Lencioni’s books and this one provides useful insights into the sorts of things that might provide different people either joy or frustration at work. I used the model from the book with my team at Meta for our second team “summit” (aka offsite in the world of Finance) and found it very helpful.\nSeven Brief Lessons On Physics by Carlo Rovelli: Another slim volume from Carlos Rovelli that packs many interesting facts to ponder on, wrapped up in Rovelli’s at times poetic style of writing.\nThe Lion Tracker’s Guide To Life by Boyd Varty: Recommended by a friend who grew up in South Africa and has received personal coaching by Varty. The book provides insights into a whole world that I knew very little about but that we can learn a lot from.\nThe Psychology Of Money - Timeless Lessons On Wealth, Greed, And Happiness by Morgan Housel: This felt like a series of essays on how to live, but using money and wealth as a hook. I enjoyed it."

Easy, short read that is valuable for anyone working in a team (which is pretty much everyone).\nBe The Hero - Three Powerful Ways To Overcome Challenges In Work And Life by Noah Blumenthal: Another short and easy read in the “business fable” genre.

The premise is that there are people whose life keeps repeating starting from birth but they remember everything they experienced and learnt in previous lives. The chief protagonist, Harry August, is one such person. Well thought out and generally self-consistent - I recommend it if you like the genre.\nUnderground Airlines by Ben Winters: A book in the “alternative history” genre, which is another genre I like. The premise here is that the American Civil War never happened and slavery is still legal in 4 US states."

    "text": "I’ve only read 17 books in 2020. I started well, completing 10 books by the end of February, but then Covid happened. Working from home killed my reading velocity. The roughly 3 hours a day I spent commuting was my reading time. I would typically read non-fiction during the morning commute when my brain was sharp and able to absorb new ideas. On the way home, I would escape to fiction. I still haven’t been able to replace that commute time with at-home reading time on a regular basis. There always seems to be something slightly more pressing to do at home than sitting down and reading a book.\nIn any case, my standout book so far in 2020 has been Spillover - Animal Infections And The Next Human Pandemic by David Quammen. Essential reading for a Covid-19 world.\nThe Art of Statistics - How To Learn From Data by David Spiegelhalter was an entertaining and educational tour through the world of statistics.\nI enjoyed listening to Alchemy: The Dark Art and Curious Science of Creating Magic in Brands, Business, and Life by Rory Sutherland. The content was thought-provoking and the narration by the author was excellent."

    "text": "Non-Fiction Recommendation\nThe Information: A History, A Theory, A Flood by James Gleick was my stand out non-fiction read of 2025. Despite being published back in 2011, it feels super relevant today as large language models take over the world. This book is about the essence of language - the information conveyed by words or other codes. As the subtitle alludes to, the book is a history of how humans have conveyed information to each other, leading to an exposition of Claude Shannon’s Information Theory, and ending with a discussion of the flood of information brought about by the internet age. I would love to read a follow up by Gleick on the new world of LLMs and Generative AI.\nThe following quote from the book’s epilogue feels almost prophetic:\n\nWe are all patrons of the Library of Babel now, and we are the librarians, too. We veer from elation to dismay and back. “When it was proclaimed that the Library contained all books,” Borges tells us, “the first impression was one of extravagant happiness. All men felt themselves to be the masters of an intact and secret treasure. There was no personal or world problem whose eloquent solution did not exist in some hexagon. The universe was justified.” Then come the lamentations. What good are the precious books that cannot be found? What good is complete knowledge, in its immobile perfection? Borges worries: “The certitude that everything has been written negates us or turns us into phantoms.”\n\nAn honorable mention goes to Making Sense of Chaos: A Better Economics for a Better World by J. Doyne Farmer in which the author argues for the new paradigm of Complexity Economics that uses simulation to model the economy. It’s partly a discussion on how classical economics models have failed and how new agent-based models can do a better job, and partly a memoir of Farmer’s journey through the fields of chaos theory and complex systems."

The book has one of the most innovative basic premises I’ve come across in a long time. It had my attention from the first chapter with its mind-bending portrayal of a world where humans battle anti-memes, entities which can erase themselves from human memory. It turns out it’s quite complicated to fight entities that can make you forget they even exist! Highly recommended if you are a sci-fi fan.\nHonorable mentions go to The Unlikely Escape of Uriah Heep by H.G. Parry which also had an intriguing premise - that it is possible to read characters out of a book and into existence. If you like Dickens and other Victorian-era authors like Arthur Conan Doyle, I’m sure you will enjoy this novel.\nA final honorable mention to James by Percival Everett which re-imagines the Adventures of Huckleberry Finn through the eyes of the runaway slave, Jim."

Changing a Leopard’s Spots: The Adventures of Two Wildlife Trackers by Alex Van Den Heever is the story of how Alex and Renias bonded as a guide and tracker team in the Londolozi Reserve adjacent to Kruger and ended up creating a Tracker Academy to train Africans in the fast-disappearing arts of the tracker. A great book, even if you haven’t met Renias - if you read it, you’ll want to!\nI wish I had read Animal Societies: How Co-Operation Conquered the Natural World by Ashley Ward before going on the safari - a fascinating tour of animal societies from the smallest insects to the largest mammals, including many I encountered on the safari, such as lions, elephants and hyenas.\nOn the other hand, I’m glad I didn’t read The Tiger: A True Story of Vengeance and Survival before going on safari. The book tells the story of an Amur tiger in the remote Primorye region in the Russian Far East that tracked and killed a hunter in a seeming act of vengeance. If I had read about the truly awesome abilities and power of the Amur tiger, I may have thought twice about trying to get close to its smaller cousin the African lion."

    "text": "From Russia With Love\nThere was definite Russian theme weaving through many of the books I read this year, starting with Tolstoy’s War and Peace. The lengthy novel (the Audiobook was more than 60 hours long) was part family drama, part history and part political philosophy. I really enjoyed the family drama and the characters, was pulled in to the history but was not so enamoured of the political philosophy. In particular, I could have done without slogging through the Epilogue.\nI continued with my journey through Russian authors with Dostoevsky’s Crime and Punishment followed by Notes from Underground. I’m glad I read the former, despite it being a little dour, but struggled through the latter. I will wait until I’ve read The Brother’s Karamazov before making a final decision on whether I am a Dostoevsky fan.\nThe Story of Russia by Orlando Figes provided some welcome context to those novels, telling the history of Russia and the stories told by Russians about their history. The already mentioned The Tiger: A True Story of Vengeance and Survival also conveys a lot of interesting history of the Russian Far East.\nIn addition to these books, I read quite a few spy novels, many of which had Russian antagonists…."

The Oligarch’s Daughter by Joseph Finder tells the tale of an ordinary finance-bro who gets caught up with a Russian Oligarch and the FBI. A couple of other spy novels I read were more centered on the Middle East than Russia. Damascus Station by David McCloskey was set in the Syria of the Assad regime. State of Terror was co-authored by Hilary Clinton and is a bit hokey but primarily of interest due to the author."

It doesn’t hold back on her train-wreck marriage with Anthony Weiner either, but for me the most interesting part was her family history and early life living in Jeddah.\nGet In: The Inside Story of Labour Under Starmer by Patrick Maguire and Gabriel Pogrund reveals the inner workings of the British Labor party and how Martin McSweeney, a Labour operative and Irishman, engineered Keir Starmer’s path to power, primarily, it seems, to force Jeremy Corbyn and old-Labour out of power. For me one of the many interesting insights was the influence of the Labour Friends of Israel lobby-group and pro-Israel businessmen such as Trevor Chinn on bringing Jeremy Corbyn down."

Being Jewish After the Destruction of Gaza: A Reckoning by Peter Beinart gives lie to the common assertion that criticism of Israel is intrinsically anti-semitic. Instead he opposes the “idolatry of the state” and strives to reclaim human equality and justice as the true expression of Jewish tradition."

Ergodic systems are systems in which ensemble averages (the average outcome of a group at a specific point in time) and time averages (the average outcome of a single individual over a long period) are identical. Most systems in the real world are non-ergodic and it’s important to understand the implications.\nUltralearning: Master Hard Skills, Outsmart the Competition, and Accelerate Your Career by Scott Young provides a practical guide to acquiring skills and knowledge that is both self-directed and intense.\nBlack Box Thinking: Why Some People Never Learn from Their Mistakes - But Some Do by British journalist Matthew Syed investigates the relationship between failure and success, arguing that the most effective individuals and organizations are those that treat errors as learning opportunities rather than embarrassments to be concealed. It was published back in 2015 and is still worth a read."

Field names can be changed without impact but field tags cannot be changed without invalidating any data already written. To maintain forward compatibility, a new scheme can add a field (using a new field tag) - old code will just skip the bytes following an unrecognized field tag. For backward compatibility, a new field can be added so long as it is optional - otherwise new code reading old data will not find the new required field. When removing a field, to maintain both forward and backward compatibility, the removed field must be optional (and you can’t use the same field tag again).\nAvro handles schema evolution by storing the writer’s schema in the file. When code with a new schema reads the file, it can compare the new schema with the old schema in the file. To maintain compatibility, only fields with a default value can be added or removed."

Clara’s been arrested for the murder of Rachel Stapleton, a wealthy housewife and prominent figure in Lavender Valley, their well-to-do New Jersey suburb. But she swears she did not commit the crime.\nSimon knows that Clara is not capable of murder and will do anything he can to prove her innocence—he’s felt indebted to the Coleman family since her husband, Will, Simon’s best friend, passed away years before. He arrives in Lavender Valley and hits the ground running on the case. With time, details surrounding the crime as well as the Colemans’ family history are revealed, unravelling the complex web of cause and effect that will finally bring the truth to light. ”"

    "title": "The Story of Russia",
    "section": "Key Points:",
    "text": "Key Points:\n\nHistory as Ideology:\nThe central thesis of the book is that in Russia, history is not merely a record of the past but a political tool. From the Tsars to the Soviets to Vladimir Putin, rulers have consistently rewritten narratives to justify autocracy and territorial expansion. Figes argues that to understand modern Russia, one must understand the specific historical myths the nation tells about itself.\n\n\nThe Origins in Kievan Rus:\nFiges explores the shared and contested heritage of the Kievan Rus (9th–13th centuries). Both Russia and Ukraine claim this period as their genesis. The book details how Moscow later co-opted the legacy of Kiev to justify its dominion over Ukrainian lands, framing Russians, Belarusians, and Ukrainians as one “triune people.”\n\n\nThe Mongol Impact on Autocracy:\nThe Mongol invasion (the “Tartar Yoke”) is identified as a pivotal moment that severed Russia from European development. Figes notes that the Muscovite princes adopted Mongol administrative practices, specifically the concept of the state as the private property of the ruler (votchina), which laid the groundwork for the Russian tradition of absolute autocracy and the weakness of private property rights.\n\n\nThe Sacralization of Power:\nUnder Ivan the Terrible and the Romanov dynasty, the Tsar was elevated to a semi-divine figure. The book highlights the persistent Russian longing for a “strong hand” (tverdaya ruka) and a “Holy Tsar” to protect the nation from internal chaos and external enemies.\n\n\nWesternizers vs. Slavophiles:\nA recurring theme is the identity crisis between looking West (Peter the Great’s reforms) and looking East (Eurasianism). Figes details the 19th-century intellectual split between those who believed Russia should emulate Europe and those who believed Russia possessed a unique, superior spiritual civilization distinct from the “corrupt” West.\n\n\nThe Soviet Reconstruction:\nThe Bolsheviks initially sought to destroy the memory of Imperial Russia but eventually rehabilitated figures like Ivan the Terrible and Peter the Great under Stalin to justify totalitarianism. The victory in 1945 (The Great Patriotic War) became the foundational myth of the late Soviet and current Russian state, functioning as a civic religion that tolerates no dissent.\n\n\nPost-Soviet Trauma and Resentment:\nThe collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 is described not as a liberation, but, for many Russians, as a catastrophic loss of status and empire. Figes documents how the chaos of the 1990s discredited Western-style democracy and paved the way for a return to authoritarianism.\n\n\nPutin’s Use of History:\nThe final chapters analyze Vladimir Putin’s utilization of historical grievances. Figes explains how Putin synthesized Tsarist imperialism and Soviet power (while ignoring Marxist ideology) to create a nationalist narrative. This narrative relies on the idea that Russia is a “besieged fortress” constantly under threat from the West.\n\n\nThe War in Ukraine:\nThe book concludes with the context of the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Figes asserts that the war was driven by historical mythology—specifically Putin’s belief that Ukraine is an artificial state with no right to exist outside of the Russian sphere of influence."

This patrimonial concept of the state… would prevent the development of a legal order based on the rights of private property.” (p. 48)\n\n\n“The Great Patriotic War became the founding myth of the Soviet regime… It was a cult of the war dead, a civic religion, with its own saints and rituals, which legitimized the Soviet system and its sacrifices.” (p. 215)\n\n\n“Putin was not restoring the Soviet system… He was restoring the state, and in that mission he was willing to use any symbol from the past that would strengthen his authority and appeal to the patriotism of the Russian people.” (p. 285)"

For most people, conflict triggers a fight or flight response. Disagreeing productively is a hard skill for which neither evolution or society has equipped us. It’s a skill we urgently need to acquire; otherwise, our increasingly vociferous disagreements are destined to tear us apart. Productive disagreement is a way of thinking, perhaps the best one we have. It makes us smarter and more creative, and it can even bring us closer together. It’s critical to the success of any shared enterprise, from a marriage, to a business, to a democracy. Isn’t it time we gave more thought to how to do it well? In an increasingly polarized world, our only chance for coming together and moving forward is to learn from those who have mastered the art and science of disagreement. In this book, we’ll learn from experts who are highly skilled at getting the most out of highly charged encounters: interrogators, cops, divorce mediators, therapists, diplomats, psychologists. These professionals know how to get something valuable - information, insight, ideas–from the toughest, most antagonistic conversations. They are brilliant communicators: masters at shaping the conversation beneath the conversation. They know how to turn the heat of conflict into the light of creativity, connection, and insight. In this much-need book, Ian Leslie explores what happens to us when we argue, why disagreement makes us stressed, and why we get angry. He explains why we urgently need to transform the way we think about conflict and how having better disagreements can make us more successful. By drawing together the lessons he learns from different experts, he proposes a series of clear principles that we can all use to make our most difficult dialogues more productive–and our increasingly acrimonious world a better place."

As with the first reading I got through the first three books very quickly and enjoyed reminding myself of the plot intricacies and nuanced characterization that the tv series could not show. However, things slowed down dramatically with the fourth book, A Feast for Crows, and it was a bit of a slog to get to the end. So much so that I couldn’t really motivate myself to start the fifth book. Perhaps I will read it prior to the start of the next season of the tv series."

    "text": "Story Arc and Plot Summary\nThe narrative is told from the perspective of Rob Sutherland, a pragmatic lawyer who has spent his life protecting his younger brother, Charley. Charley possesses the uncontrolled ability to summon characters from books into reality. While most of these manifestations represent “echoes”—temporary, pale imitations of the characters that eventually fade—some are solid and permanent.\nThe inciting incident occurs when Charley, now an adult academic and literature professor, unintentionally summons Uriah Heep, the antagonist from Charles Dickens’s David Copperfield. Unlike previous summons, Heep is fully sentient, refuses to return to the page, and possesses a terrifying ability to adapt to the modern world. Simultaneously, Charley discovers that he is not the only one with this ability; a secret society of summoners exists in Wellington, maintaining a hidden sanctuary for fictional refugees in a “New Street” concealed within the city.\nThe plot thickens as a mysterious sickness begins to affect the fictional residents, and a darker threat emerges. A powerful summoner is attempting to unravel the barrier between fiction and reality, intending to rewrite the world into a Victorian dystopia. Rob and Charley must navigate a cast of literary figures—including a feral version of the five children from E. Nesbit’s works, a melancholic Heathcliff from Wuthering Heights, and the titular Uriah Heep—to uncover the conspiracy.\nThe climax involves a desperate confrontation where the brothers must rely on literary analysis as a weapon. They realize that characters are not static; they are defined by how they are interpreted by readers. To defeat the antagonist, they must reinterpret the narratives that bind the villains, effectively rewriting their roles to save Wellington."

Rob defines himself by his protective role over Charley, often at the expense of his own happiness and autonomy. His arc focuses on moving from a position of resentment and weary guardianship to understanding his own value. He is the grounding force in the narrative, representing the “reader” who engages with the text but remains firmly in reality.\nCharley Sutherland: A brilliant but anxious academic who views his power as a curse. Charley struggles with the guilt of potentially unleashing monsters upon the world. His development centers on gaining agency over his abilities. Rather than repressing his imagination, he learns that disciplined interpretation—understanding the “why” of a story—grants him control.\nUriah Heep: Parry presents Heep not merely as the sycophantic villain of Dickens’s creation, but as a meta-fictional entity aware of his role in the narrative. He struggles against the determinism of his source text. Heep claims he wishes to escape his villainy, posing the question of whether a character can transcend their author’s intent. As he states, “I am not a person, Mr. Sutherland. I am a collection of words.”\nThe Literary Cast: The supporting characters serve as explorations of their source material. For example, Dorian Gray appears as a vanity-obsessed figure terrified of his own narrative ending, while Mr. Rochester manifests with the complexity of modern post-colonial and feminist critiques applied to his character."

Parry posits that reading is an act of co-creation. When Charley summons a character, he is not summoning the author’s definitive version, but a version filtered through his own perception and critical analysis. The novel suggests that stories are living things that evolve with society.\n\n\nFamily and Codependency\nThe relationship between Rob and Charley is the emotional core of the book. It examines the complexities of sibling duty. Rob’s protection of Charley has stunted both of their lives—Charley remains infantilized, and Rob remains isolated. The story arc resolves only when they dismantle this dynamic, moving from codependency to a partnership of equals.\n\n\nThe Power of Language\nMagic in this universe is inextricably linked to language and definition. The ability to name a thing or describe it accurately provides power over it. The antagonist’s threat is essentially a threat of rewriting reality, highlighting the danger of allowing a single narrative or worldview to dominate existence."

    "text": "A Keeper by Graham Norton\n\n\nisbn-13: 9781982117764\nAudible\n“From Graham Norton—the BAFTA Award-winning Irish television host and author of the “charming debut novel” (New York Journal of Books) Holding—a masterly and haunting tale of secrets and ill-fated love follows a young woman as she returns to Ireland after her mother’s death and unravels the identity of her father. When Elizabeth Keane returns to Ireland after her mother’s death, she’s focused only on saying goodbye to that dark and dismal part of her life. Her childhood home is packed solid with useless junk, her mother’s presence already fading. But within this mess, she discovers a small stash of letters—and ultimately, the truth. Forty years earlier, a young woman stumbles from a remote stone house, the night quiet except for the constant wind that encircles her as she hurries deeper into the darkness away from the cliffs and the sea. She has no sense of where she is going, only that she must keep on. With wistful and evocative prose, A Keeper is sure to appeal to “fans of sensitive character studies” (Publishers Weekly) and brilliantly illustrates Graham Norton’s clear-eyed understanding of human nature and its darkest flaws.”"

    "text": "The Art Of Statistics by David Spiegelhalter\nisbn-13: 9781541618510\nHardcover\nPublisher’s Description:\n“The definitive guide to statistical thinking Statistics are everywhere, as integral to science as they are to business, and in the popular media hundreds of times a day. In this age of big data, a basic grasp of statistical literacy is more important than ever if we want to separate the fact from the fiction, the ostentatious embellishments from the raw evidence – and even more so if we hope to participate in the future, rather than being simple bystanders. In The Art of Statistics, world- renowned statistician David Spiegelhalter shows readers how to derive knowledge from raw data by focusing on the concepts and connections behind the math. Drawing on real world examples to introduce complex issues, he shows us how statistics can help us determine the luckiest passenger on the Titanic, whether a notorious serial killer could have been caught earlier, and if screening for ovarian cancer is beneficial. The Art of Statistics not only shows us how mathematicians have used statistical science to solve these problems – it teaches us how we too can think like statisticians. We learn how to clarify our questions, assumptions, and expectations when approaching a problem, and – perhaps even more importantly – we learn how to responsibly interpret the answers we receive. Combining the incomparable insight of an expert with the playful enthusiasm of an aficionado, The Art of Statistics is the definitive guide to stats that every modern person needs.”"

    "text": "Notes\n\nEpistemic Uncertainty\n\nepistemic uncertainty: lack of knowledge about facts, numbers or scientific hypotheses.\n\n\n\nAleatory Uncertainty\n\naleatory uncertainty: unavoidable unpredictability about the future, also known as chance, randomness, luck and so on.\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n\nTurning experiences into data is not straightforward, and data is inevitably limited in its capacity to describe the world.\nStatistical science has a long and successful history, but is now changing in the light of increased availability of data.\nSkill in statistical methods plays an important part of being a data scientist.\nTeaching statistics is changing from a focus on mathematical methods to one based on an entire problem-solving cycle.\nThe PPDAC cycle provides a convenient framework: Problem - Plan - Data - Analysis – Conclusion and communication.\nData literacy is a key skill for the modern world.\n\n\n\nGetting Things In Proportion\n\nBinary variables are yes/no questions, sets of which can be summarized as proportions.\nPositive or negative framing of proportions can change their emotional impact.\nRelative risks tend to convey an exaggerated importance, and absolute risks should be provided for clarity.\nExpected frequencies promote understanding and an appropriate sense of importance.\nOdds ratios arise from scientific studies but should not be used for general communication.\nGraphics need to be chosen with care and awareness of their impact.\n\n\n\nSummarizing and Communicating Numbers. Lots of Number\n\nA variety of statistics can be used to summarize the empirical distribution of data-points, including measures of location and spread.\nSkewed data distributions are common, and some summary statistics are very sensitive to outlying values.\nData summaries always hide some detail, and care is required so that important information is not lost.\nSingle sets of numbers can be visualized in strip- charts, box-and-whisker plots and histograms.\nConsider transformations to better reveal patterns, and use the eye to detect patterns, outliers, similarities and clusters.\nLook at pairs of numbers as scatter-plots, and time- series as line-graphs.\nWhen exploring data, a primary aim is to find factors that explain the overall variation.\nGraphics can be both interactive and animated.\nInfographics highlight interesting features and can guide the viewer through a story, but should be used with awareness of their purpose and their impact.\n\n\n\nWhy Are We Looking At Data Anyway? Populations and Measurement\n\nInductive inference requires working from our data, through study sample and study population, to a target population.\nProblems and biases can crop up at each stage of this path.\nThe best way to proceed from sample to study population is to have drawn a random sample.\nA population can be thought of as a group of individuals, but also as providing the probability distribution for a random observation drawn from that population.\nPopulations can be summarized using parameters that mirror the summary statistics of sample data.\nOften data does not arise as a sample from a literal population. When we have all the data there is, then we can imagine it drawn from a metaphorical population of events that could have occurred, but didn’t.\n\n\n\nWhat Causes What?\n\nCausation, in the statistical sense, means that when we intervene, the chances of different outcomes are systematically changed.\nCausation is difficult to establish statistically, but well-designed randomized trials are the best available framework.\nPrinciples of blinding, intention-to-treat and so on have enabled large-scale clinical trials to identify moderate but important effects.\nObservational data may have background factors influencing the apparent observed relationships between an exposure and an outcome, which may be either observed confounders or lurking factors.\nStatistical methods exist for adjusting for other factors, but judgement is always required as to the confidence with which causation can be claimed.\n\n\n\nModeling Relationships Using Regression\n\nRegression models provide a mathematical representation between a set of explanatory variables and a response variable.\nThe coefficients in a regression model indicate how much we expect the response to change when the explanatory variable is observed to change.\nRegression-to-the-mean occurs when more extreme responses revert to nearer the long-term average, since a contribution to their previous extremeness was pure chance.\nRegression models can incorporate different types of response variable, explanatory variables and non- linear relationships.\nCaution is required in interpreting models, which should not be taken too literally: ’All models are wrong, but some are useful.\n\n\n\nAlgorithms, Analytics and Prediction\n\nAlgorithms built from data can be used for classification and prediction in technological applications .\nIt is important to guard against over-fitting an algorithm to training data , essentially fitting to noise rather than signal\nAlgorithms can be evaluated by the classification accuracy , their ability to discriminate between groups , and their overall predictive accuracy\nComplex algorithms may lack transparency , and it may be worth trading off some accuracy for comprehension\nThe use of algorithms and artificial intelligence presents many challenges , and insights into both the power and limitations of machine-learning methods is vital\n\n\n\nHow Sure Can We Be About What Is Going On? Estimates and Intervals\n\nUncertainty intervals are an important part of communicating statistics.\nBootstrapping a sample consists of creating new data sets of the same size by resampling the original data, with replacement.\nSample statistics calculated from bootstrap re- samples tend towards a normal distribution for larger data sets, regardless of the shape of the original data distribution.\nUncertainty intervals based on bootstrapping take advantage of modern computer power, do not require assumptions about the mathematical form of the population and do not require complex probability theory.\n\n\n\nProbability- the Language of Uncertainty and Variability\n\nThe theory of probability provides a formal language and mathematics for dealing with chance phenomena.\nThe implications of probability are not intuitive, but insights can be improved by using the idea of expected frequencies.\nThe ideas of probability are useful even when there is no explicit use of a randomizing mechanism.\nMany social phenomena show a remarkable regularity in their overall pattern, while individual events are entirely unpredictable.\n\n\n\nPutting Probability and Statistics Together\n\nProbability theory can be used to derive the sampling distribution of summary statistics, from which formulae for confidence intervals can be derived.\nA 95% confidence interval is the result of a procedure that, in 95% of cases in which its assumptions are correct, will contain the true parameter value. It cannot be claimed that a specific interval has 95% probability of containing the true value.\nThe Central Limit Theorem implies that sample means and other summary statistics can be assumed to have a normal distribution for large samples.\nMargins of error usually do not incorporate systematic error due to non-random causes – external knowledge and judgement is required to assess these.\nConfidence intervals can be calculated even when we observe all the data, which then represent uncertainty about the parameters of an underlying metaphorical population.\n\n\n\nAnswering Questions and Claiming Discoveries\n\nTests of null hypotheses - default assumptions about statistical models – form a major part of statistical practice.\nA P-value is a measure of the incompatibility between the observed data and a null hypothesis: formally it is the probability of observing such an extreme result, were the null hypothesis true.\nTraditionally, P-value thresholds of 0.05 and 0.01 have been set to declare ‘statistical significance’.\nThese thresholds need to be adjusted if multiple tests are conducted, for example on different subsets of the data or multiple outcome measures.\nThere is a precise correspondence between confidence intervals and P-values: if, say, the 95% interval excludes 0, we can reject the null hypothesis of 0 at P &lt; 0.05.\nNeyman-Pearson theory specifies an alternative hypothesis, and fixes Type I and Type II error rates for the two possible kinds of errors in a hypothesis test.\nSeparate forms of hypothesis tests have been developed for sequential testing.\nP-values are often misinterpreted: in particular they do not convey the probability that the null hypothesis is true, nor does a non-significant result imply that the null hypothesis is true.\n\n\n\nLearning from Experience the Bayesian Way\n\nBayesian methods combine evidence from data (summarized by the likelihood) with initial beliefs (known as the prior distribution) to produce a posterior probability distribution for the unknown quantity.\nBayes’ theorem for two competing hypotheses can be expressed as posterior odds = likelihood ratio x prior odds.\nThe likelihood ratio expresses the relative support for two hypotheses from an item of evidence, and is sometimes used to summarize forensic evidence in criminal trials.\nWhen the prior distribution comes from some physical sampling process, Bayesian methods are uncontroversial. However generally a degree of judgement is necessary.\nHierarchical models allow evidence to be pooled across multiple small analyses that are assumed to have parameters in common.\nBayes factors are the equivalent of likelihood ratios for scientific hypotheses, and are a controversial substitute for null-hypothesis significance testing.\nThe theory of statistical inference has a long history of controversy, but issues of quality of data and scientific reliability are more important.\n\n\n\nHow Things Go Wrong\n\nPoor statistical practice has some responsibility for the crisis in the reproducibility of science.\nDeliberate fabrication of data appears to be fairly rare, but errors in statistical methods are frequent.\nAn even greater problem is questionable research practices that tend to lead to exaggerated claims of statistical significance.\nIn the pipeline by which statistical evidence reaches the public, press offices, journalists and editors add to the flow of unjustified statistical claims through their use of questionable interpretation and communication practices.\n\n\nHow We Can Do Statistics Better\n\nProducers, communicators and audiences all have a role in improving the way that statistical science is used in society.\nProducers need to ensure that science is reproducible. To demonstrate trustworthiness, information should be accessible, intelligible, assessable and useable.\nCommunicators need to be wary of trying to fit statistical stories into standard narratives.\nAudiences need to call out poor practice by asking questions about the trustworthiness of their numbers, their source and their interpretation.\nWhen faced with a claim based on statistical evidence, first feel whether it seems plausible.\n\n\n\n\nRules for Effective Statistical Practice\n\nStatistical methods should enable data to answer scientific questions: Ask ‘why am I doing this?’, rather than focusing on which particular technique to use.\nSignals always come with noise: It is trying to separate out the two that makes the subject interesting. Variability is inevitable, and probability models are useful as an abstraction.\nPlan ahead, really ahead: This includes the idea of pre- specification in confirmatory experiments - avoiding researcher degrees of freedom.\nWorry about data quality: Everything rests on the data.\nStatistical analysis is more than a set of computations: Do not just plug into formulae or run procedures in software, without knowing why you are doing so.\nKeep it simple: The main communication should be as basic as possible - do not show off skills in complex modelling unless they are really necessary.\nProvide assessments of variability: With the warning that margins of error are generally bigger than claimed.\nCheck your assumptions: And make clear when this has not been possible.\nWhen possible, replicate!: Or encourage others to do so.\nMake your analysis reproducible: Others should be able to access your data and code."

    "text": "Introduction\n“The Way We Live Now” is a satirical novel by Anthony Trollope, first published in serial form between 1874 and 1875. Written shortly after Trollope’s return to England from abroad, the novel was born out of the author’s indignation at what he perceived as the moral decline of Victorian society. It serves as a scathing critique of the commercial profligacy and dishonesty that characterized the era’s financial and social interactions [1]. Often regarded as Trollope’s masterpiece, the work captures a specific historical moment dominated by speculative bubbles and the erosion of traditional values in favor of wealth and status [2]."

    "text": "Overview of the story\nThe narrative centers on the arrival of Augustus Melmotte in London, a financier of mysterious origins and rumored immense wealth. Melmotte establishes a company to construct the “South Central Pacific and Mexican Railway,” a grand but largely fraudulent enterprise. Despite widespread rumors of his dishonesty, the London social elite, desperate to fund their lavish lifestyles, flock to him. Melmotte’s ascent is rapid; he is elected to Parliament and even entertains the Emperor of China, symbolizing the complete submission of high society to the power of money [3].\nEntwined with Melmotte’s rise is the story of the Carbury family. Lady Carbury, a struggling authoress who relies on charm rather than talent to sell her books, is devoted to her son, Sir Felix Carbury. Felix is a handsome but morally bankrupt idler who gambles away his mother’s resources at the “Beargarden” club. Lady Carbury schemes for Felix to marry Marie Melmotte, Augustus’s daughter, solely to secure her dowry. However, Felix’s laziness and incompetence lead to his failure to win Marie, and he is eventually exposed as a scoundrel [1].\nMeanwhile, a romantic triangle develops involving Paul Montague, a young partner in Melmotte’s railway scheme who begins to suspect fraud. Paul is in love with Hetta Carbury, Lady Carbury’s daughter, but finds himself entangled with Mrs. Winifred Hurtle, an impetuous American widow with a violent past. Watching over these events is Roger Carbury, a country squire who represents traditional English integrity. Though he also loves Hetta, he ultimately steps aside to allow her to marry Paul, acting as the novel’s moral anchor [3].\nThe story culminates in the collapse of Melmotte’s financial empire. Exposed for forging signatures to access trust funds and abandoned by the society that once fawned over him, Melmotte commits suicide. In the aftermath, the characters face their respective fates: Marie Melmotte refuses to be a pawn and moves to America with her fortune; Sir Felix is ruined and exiled; and Paul and Hetta marry, securing a stable future under the protection of Roger Carbury [4]."

His obscure origins and meteoric rise mirror the financial instability of the period, representing the corrupting power of unchecked capitalism [2].\nLady Carbury is a pragmatic and manipulative matriarch who sacrifices everything for her worthless son. She represents the compromises made by the literary and social worlds, using connections and flattery to survive in a competitive environment [1].\nSir Felix Carbury personifies the moral decay of the younger generation. Beautiful but hollow, he feels entitled to wealth without work, relying on gambling and marriage schemes to support his dissipated lifestyle [4].\nRoger Carbury serves as the moral compass of the book. As a traditional landowner, he embodies the virtues of “Old England”—honesty, duty, and stability—standing in stark contrast to the volatile and deceptive world of Melmotte [3].\nMarie Melmotte, initially a passive figure, evolves into a hardened and independent woman. Realizing that her noble suitors are only interested in her money, she rejects the social climbing game entirely [1].\nPaul Montague is a flawed but fundamentally decent character who struggles to extricate himself from both moral and romantic entanglements. His journey involves rejecting the easy wealth of Melmotte’s scheme and the chaotic passion of Mrs. Hurtle in favor of an honest life with Hetta [3]."

    "text": "Overview of the themes\nGreed and Corruption permeate the novel, illustrated by the aristocracy’s willingness to debase themselves for Melmotte’s money. Trollope satirizes a society where wealth has replaced honor as the ultimate measure of worth, and where speculative bubbles are embraced despite their obvious risks [2].\nThe Marriage Market is depicted as a cynical business exchange rather than a romantic union. Characters like Georgiana Longestaffe and Sir Felix Carbury view marriage strictly as a means to acquire financial security or social status, highlighting the commodification of personal relationships [1].\nAnti-Semitism is a complex theme within the book. While the villainous Melmotte is rumored to be Jewish, Trollope creates a counterpoint in Mr. Brehgert, a Jewish banker who acts with honor and dignity. The prejudice Brehgert faces from the foolish Christian aristocracy serves to critique their hypocrisy rather than validate their bigotry [3].\nOld vs. New contrasts the traditional, landed gentry represented by Roger Carbury with the new, chaotic force of international finance. This tension underscores the anxiety of the Victorian era regarding the displacement of established social orders by modern commercialism [4]."

By weaving together the fates of aristocrats, financiers, and writers, Trollope creates a comprehensive panorama of Victorian London that exposes the hollowness of a culture built on speculation and pretense. The novel concludes with a restoration of order, but the scars left by Melmotte’s influence serve as a lasting warning against the abandonment of integrity for the sake of “the way we live now.”"

When Captain Abrashoff took over as commander of USS Benfold, it was like a business that had all the latest technology but only some of the productivity. Knowing that responsibility for improving performance rested with him, he realized he had to improve his own leadership skills before he could improve his ship. Within months, he created a crew of confident and inspired problem-solvers eager to take the initiative and responsibility for their actions. The slogan on board became “It’s your ship,” and Benfold was soon recognized far and wide as a model of naval efficiency. How did Abrashoff do it? Against the backdrop of today’s United States Navy, Abrashoff shares his secrets of successful management including: See the ship through the eyes of the crew: By soliciting a sailor’s suggestions, Abrashoff drastically reduced tedious chores that provided little additional value. Communicate, communicate, communicate: The more Abrashoff communicated the plan, the better the crew’s performance. His crew eventually started calling him “Megaphone Mike,” since they heard from him so often. Create discipline by focusing on purpose: Discipline skyrocketed when Abrashoff’s crew believed that what they were doing was important. Listen aggressively: After learning that many sailors wanted to use the GI Bill, Abrashoff brought a test official aboard the ship-and held the SATs forty miles off the Iraqi coast. From achieving amazing cost savings to winning the highest gunnery score in the Pacific Fleet, Captain Abrashoff’s extraordinary campaign sent shock waves through the U.S. Navy. It can help you change the course of your ship, no matter where your business battles are fought."

He warned of the perils ahead, ending his note, “in the name of God, let Palestine be left alone.” Thus Rashid Khalidi, al-Khalidi’s great-great- nephew, begins this sweeping history, the first general account of the conflict told from an explicitly Palestinian perspective. Drawing on a wealth of untapped archival materials and the reports of generations of family members—mayors, judges, scholars, diplomats, and journalists—The Hundred Years’ War on Palestine upends accepted interpretations of the conflict, which tend, at best, to describe a tragic clash between two peoples with claims to the same territory. Instead, Khalidi traces a hundred years of colonial war on the Palestinians, waged first by the Zionist movement and then Israel, but backed by Britain and the United States, the great powers of the age. He highlights the key episodes in this colonial campaign, from the 1917 Balfour Declaration to the destruction of Palestine in 1948, from Israel’s 1982 invasion of Lebanon to the endless and futile peace process. Original, authoritative, and important, The Hundred Years’ War on Palestine is not a chronicle of victimization, nor does it whitewash the mistakes of Palestinian leaders or deny the emergence of national movements on both sides. In reevaluating the forces arrayed against the Palestinians, it offers an illuminating new view of a conflict that continues to this day."

Organizational psychologist and executive coach Rebecca Newton has found that even her most successful clients still want more of one quality: gravitas. They want their words to carry weight, to have a positive, lasting impact on those around them. Gravitas can seem like an elusive, intangible quality, but it isn’t about adopting the style of another or being someone you’re not. Newton draws on extensive research and experience coaching business leaders to show what underpins authentic gravitas and how anyone can develop it. She presents the counterintuitive idea that in order to be valued, we shouldn’t spend all our time and energy trying to stand out from the crowd; instead, we should focus on the crowd–connecting with others and understanding their needs in order to make a significant difference. Newton debunks the myths of gravitas and gives readers the practical tools to develop it by:  Minimizing the gaps between intention, action, and impact  Remaining true to yourself while adapting to work successfully with people who have different styles * Choosing to be courageous regardless of how confident you feel–as you engage in courageous behaviors, confidence naturally builds Authentic gravitas extends beyond commanding presence in the room during a key meeting; it’s about the small things you can do beforehand, during, and in all the spaces in between–to be someone who genuinely adds substantive value in the workplace and beyond."

Assuming you live to be eighty, you have just over four thousand weeks. Nobody needs telling there isn’t enough time. We’re obsessed with our lengthening to-do lists, our overfilled inboxes, work-life balance, and the ceaseless battle against distraction; and we’re deluged with advice on becoming more productive and efficient, and “life hacks” to optimize our days. But such techniques often end up making things worse. The sense of anxious hurry grows more intense, and still the most meaningful parts of life seem to lie just beyond the horizon. Still, we rarely make the connection between our daily struggles with time and the ultimate time management problem: the challenge of how best to use our four thousand weeks. Drawing on the insights of both ancient and contemporary philosophers, psychologists, and spiritual teachers, Oliver Burkeman delivers an entertaining, humorous, practical, and ultimately profound guide to time and time management. Rejecting the futile modern fixation on “getting everything done,” Four Thousand Weeks introduces readers to tools for constructing a meaningful life by embracing finitude, showing how many of the unhelpful ways we’ve come to think about time aren’t inescapable, unchanging truths, but choices we’ve made as individuals and as a society–and that we could do things differently."

    "text": "Numbers Don’t Lie by Vaclav Smil\n\n\nisbn-13: 9780143136224\nPaperback\nThis was a book chosen by another of the multiple book clubs I’m part of at Meta (née Facebook). I’m glad because it was a truly enlightening read. Vaclav Smil uses the numbers and data to reveal a deeper understanding of the state of our world.\nThere are 71 stories grouped into the following categories: - People: The Inhabitants of Our World - Countries: Nations in the Age of Globalization - Machines, Designs, Devices: Inventions That Made Our Modern World. - Fuels and Electricity: Energizing Our Societies - Transport: How We Get Around - Food: Energizing Ourselves\nThere are really no boring stories. Here are some excerpts from a few that were particularly memorable:\n\nHow sweating improved hunting\n\nIt all comes down to sweating. The two large animals we have mainly used for transport perspire profusely compared to other quadrupeds: in one hour, a horse can lose about 100 grams of water per square meter of skin, and a camel can lose up to 250 g/m². However, a human being can easily shed 500 g/m², enough to remove between 550 and 600 watts’ worth of heat. Peak hourly sweating rates can surpass 2 kilograms per square meter, and the highest reported short-term sweating rate is twice that high.\nWe are the superstars of sweating, and we need to be. An amateur running the marathon at a slow pace will consume energy at a rate of 700-800 watts, and an experienced marathoner who covers the 42.2 kilometers in 2.5 hours will metabolize at a rate of about 1,300 watts.\n\n\n\nHow many people did it take to build the Great Pyramid?\n\nPeople are able to convert about 20 percent of food into useful work, and for hard-working men that energy amounts to about 440 kilojoules a day.\n\n\n\nBrexit: Realities that matter most will not change\n\nThe country’s old-age dependency ratio (number of people 65 and older as a share of all economically active people 20-64 years of age), standing at 32 percent in 2020 – still slightly lower than in France or Germany - will increase to 47% by the year 2050. No government intervention and no declaration of regained sovereignty and severance from the bureaucrats of Brussels will have any effect on this inexorable process.\n\n\nGiven these fundamental realities, a rational observer must wonder what tangible differences, what clear benefits could any reassertion of British insularity bring. False claims can be painted on buses, extravagant promises are easy to make, feelings of pride or satisfaction may become fleetingly convincing - but none of those intangibles can change what the UK has become: an aging nation; a deindustrialized and worn-out country whose per capita GDP is now just over half of the Irish mean (something that Swift, Gladstone, or Churchill would find utterly unfathomable); another has-been power whose claim to uniqueness rests on having too many troubled princes and on exporting costumed TV series set in fading country mansions staffed with too many servants.\n\n\n\nConcerns about Japan’s future\n\nIn the long run, the fortunes of nations are determined by population trends. Japan is not only the world’s fastest-aging major economy (already every fourth person is older than 65, and by 2050 that share will be nearly 40 percent), its population is also declining. Today’s 127 million will shrink to 97 million by 2050, and forecasts show shortages of the young labor force needed in construction and healthcare. Who will maintain Japan’s extensive and admirably efficient transportation infrastructures? Who will take care of the millions of old people? By 2050, people above the age of 8o will outnumber the children.\n\nPublisher’s Description: “Vaclav Smil is my favorite author… Numbers Don’t Lie takes everything that makes his writing great and boils it down into an easy-to-read format. I unabashedly recommend this book to anyone who loves learning.”–Bill Gates, GatesNotes An essential guide to understanding how numbers reveal the true state of our world–exploring a wide range of topics including energy, the environment, technology, transportation, and food production. Vaclav Smil’s mission is to make facts matter. An environmental scientist, policy analyst, and a hugely prolific author, he is Bill Gates’ go-to guy for making sense of our world. In Numbers Don’t Lie, Smil answers questions such as: What’s worse for the environment–your car or your phone? How much do the world’s cows weigh (and what does it matter)? And what makes people happy? From data about our societies and populations, through measures of the fuels and foods that energize them, to the impact of transportation and inventions of our modern world–and how all of this affects the planet itself–in Numbers Don’t Lie, Vaclav Smil takes us on a fact-finding adventure, using surprising statistics and illuminating graphs to challenge conventional thinking. Packed with fascinating information and memorable examples, Numbers Don’t Lie reveals how the US is leading a rising worldwide trend in chicken consumption, that vaccination yields the best return on investment, and why electric cars aren’t as great as we think (yet). Urgent and essential, with a mix of science, history, and wit–all in bite-sized chapters on a broad range of topics–Numbers Don’t Lie inspires readers to interrogate what they take to be true.”"

    "text": "A Man for All Markets: From Las Vegas to Wall Street, How I Beat the Dealer and the Market by Edward O. Thorp\n\n\nisbn-13: 9781400067961\nAudible\nI read this after finishing “The Man Who Solved The Market” about the founder of Renaissance Technologies’ Jim Simons. It’s interesting to compare and contrast Thorp and Simons - both came from relatively modest backgrounds, studied mathematics eventually leading Maths departments (Thorp at UC Irvine and Simons at SUNY Stony Brook) before becoming Hedge Fund managers. Thorp is older than Simons by about 6 years but started in finance about 10 years prior to Simons, founding Princeton Newport Partners (PNP) in 1969, whereas Simons started the precursor to Rennaisance Technologies in 1978. Thorp is probably more well known due to his work in trying to beat the Las Vegas casinos at Blackjack, Bacarat and Roulette (using a wearable computer he created with the help of Claude Shannon). Simons is probably the more mathematically accomplished having won the Veblen Prize in Geometry and worked for the NSA cracking codes during the Cold War. While both were very succesful as Hedge Fund managers, Thorps wealth pales in comparison to Simons.\n“A Man for All Markets” is an autobiography, whereas “The Man Who Solved the Market” is a biography written by a financial journalist with minimal co-operation from Simons. It’s no surprise then that this reader came away liking Thorp much more than Simons. Thorp certainly seems to have a more well rounded view of life and what the truly important things in life are. He stepped away from managing other peoples to spend more time with family and doing things he enjoys whereas Simons seemed much more driven to acquire more and more wealth. But, it must be taken with a pinch of salt as an autobiography is always a somewhat sanitized view of a person’s life.\nOverall the book was worth reading, although the more personal early chapters were much more interesting than the later chapters which had more editorializing from Thorp about the financial markets.\nThe audiobook was narrated by Thorp himself, which in this case was not an advantage - his narration was slow (I sped it up to 1.2x) and with somewhat strange pauses in the sentences. Sometimes the author brings something extra to a narration, but here it would probably have been better to have a professional narrator.\nPublisher’s Description\nThe incredible true story of the card-counting mathematics professor who taught the world how to beat the dealer and, as the first of the great quantitative investors, ushered in a revolution on Wall Street. A child of the Great Depression, legendary mathematician Edward O. Thorp invented card counting, proving the seemingly impossible: that you could beat the dealer at the blackjack table. As a result he launched a gambling renaissance. His remarkable success—and mathematically unassailable method—caused such an uproar that casinos altered the rules of the game to thwart him and the legions he inspired. They barred him from their premises, even put his life in jeopardy. Nonetheless, gambling was forever changed. Thereafter, Thorp shifted his sights to “the biggest casino in the world”: Wall Street. Devising and then deploying mathematical formulas to beat the market, Thorp ushered in the era of quantitative finance we live in today. Along the way, the so-called godfather of the quants played bridge with Warren Buffett, crossed swords with a young Rudy Giuliani, detected the Bernie Madoff scheme, and, to beat the game of roulette, invented, with Claude Shannon, the world’s first wearable computer. Here, for the first time, Thorp tells the story of what he did, how he did it, his passions and motivations, and the curiosity that has always driven him to disregard conventional wisdom and devise game-changing solutions to seemingly insoluble problems. An intellectual thrill ride, replete with practical wisdom that can guide us all in uncertain financial waters, A Man for All Markets is an instant classic—a book that challenges its readers to think logically about a seemingly irrational world. Praise for A Man for All Markets “In A Man for All Markets, [Thorp] delightfully recounts his progress (if that is the word) from college teacher to gambler to hedge-fund manager. Along the way we learn important lessons about the functioning of markets and the logic of investment.”—The Wall Street Journal “[Thorp] gives a biological summation (think Richard Feynman’s Surely You’re Joking, Mr. Feynman!) of his quest to prove the aphorism ‘the house always wins’ is flawed. . . . Illuminating for the mathematically inclined, and cautionary for would-be gamblers and day traders”— Library Journal"

    "text": "A Gift Of Time by Jerry Merritt\n\n\nAudible\nI’m a sucker for time-travel books and this is one of two great time-travel books I’ve read this year - the other being All Our Wrong Todays. Both of them take some effort to think through (in their own ways) some of the practical questions around time travel - e.g. do your clothes travel with you? what if you materialize into a solid object? etc.\nA Gift of Time is the deeper, more broody of the two books. The story spends a good chunk of its time (no pun intended) in 1950’s and 60’s America - these parts of the book reminded me of Stephen King’s brilliant 11/22/63 in its atmospheric evocation of fifties Americana.\nThe ending was a bit meh, but still a tremendously enjoyable book overall.\nPublisher’s Description: “When Micajah Fenton discovers a crater in his front yard with a broken time glider in the bottom and a naked, virtual woman on his lawn, he delays his plans to kill himself. While helping repair the marooned time traveler’s glider, Cager realizes it can return him to his past to correct a mistake that had haunted him his whole life. In gratitude for his help, the virtual creature living in the circuitry of the marooned glider, sends Cager back in time as his ten-year-old self, knowing everything he’d known at eighty. As a bonus, it also gives him access to advanced equations of space and time.But living life over knowing the future isn’t as easy as Cager anticipated, and he bungles his chance at correcting the most serious mistake of his life. Now he must use his new knowledge of advanced math to build his own time machine to go back and try again. Meanwhile Cager’s repairs to the creature’s glider fail, keeping it stranded near earth. In desperation, the whale-like creature sends, Ell, a near-human, female copy containing it’s consciousness to help Cager. While perfecting time travel, Cager and Ell overcome enormous problems, even being hunted by dinosaurs in the Cretaceous, and Cager falls in love with this indomitable anthropomorphic copy of a creature from across the galaxy.”"

Is it riskier to make an action movie or a horror movie? Should sex workers forfeit 50 percent of their income for added security or take a chance and keep the extra money? Most people wouldn’t expect an economist to have an answer to these questions–or to other questions of daily life, such as who to date or how early to leave for the airport. But those people haven’t met Allison Schrager, an economist and award-winning journalist who has spent her career examining how people manage risk in their lives and careers. Whether we realize it or not, we all take risks large and small every day. Even the most cautious among us cannot opt out– the question is always which risks to take, not whether to take them at all. What most of us don’t know is how to measure those risks and maximize the chances of getting what we want out of life. In An Economist Walks into a Brothel, Schrager equips readers with five principles for dealing with risk, principles used by some of the world’s most interesting risk takers. For instance, she interviews a professional poker player about how to stay rational when the stakes are high, a paparazzo in Manhattan about how to spot different kinds of risk, horse breeders in Kentucky about how to diversify risk and minimize losses, and a war general who led troops in Iraq about how to prepare for what we don’t see coming. When you start to look at risky decisions through Schrager’s new framework, you can increase the upside to any situation and better mitigate the downsides.”"

In 2006, an oddball group of bankers, traders and brokers from some of the world’s largest financial institutions made a startling realization: Libor—the London interbank offered rate, which determines interest rates on trillions in loans worldwide—was set daily by a small group of easily manipulated functionaries. Tom Hayes, a brilliant but troubled mathematician, became the lynchpin of shadowy team that used hook and crook to take over the process and set rates that made them a fortune, no matter the cost to others. Among the motley crew was a French trader nicknamed “Gollum”; the broker “Abbo,” who liked to publicly strip naked when drinking; a Kazakh chicken farmer turned something short of financial whiz kid; an executive called “Clumpy” because of his patchwork hair loss; and a broker uncreatively nicknamed “Big Nose.” Eventually known as the “Spider Network,” Hayes’s circle generated untold riches —until it all unraveled in spectacularly vicious, backstabbing fashion. Praised as reading “like a fast-paced John le Carré thriller” (New York Times), “compelling” (Washington Post) and “jaw-dropping” (Financial Times), The Spider Network is not only a rollicking account of the scam, but a provocative examination of a financial system that was warped and shady throughout."

    "text": "Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality by Less Wrong (aka Eliezer Yudkowsky)\n\n\nE-Book\nI really enjoyed this e-book. I was reading about Bayes Rule and stumbled across the essay An Intuitive Explanation of Bayes’ Theorem. From there I found the LessWrong website which had a link intriguingly entitled The Methods of Rationality. After a little more research I found the hpmor.com website and downloaded an epub version of the book.\nThe premise of the book is an alternate Harry Potter reality where rather than being raised by a cruel and ignorant aunt and uncle, instead a highly educated aunt and uncle train him in the scientific method and they emphasize a highly rational approach to the world. When Harry is introduced to the world of magic it shakes his fundamental assumptions about how the universe works. Nevertheless, he sets out to understand this strange new world of magic using rational thinking and scientific methods.\nThis is a huge book with a word count of 661,619 - for reference, the total word count in JK Rowling’s Harry Potter series is 1,084,170. I personally found the quality of the writing and plot to be very high, with many genuinely exciting scenes. If you are a dyed-in-the-wool Harry Potter fan, be prepared for many of your character assumptions to be challenged or overturned. And if you’re a Ron Weasley fan, then don’t bother with this book.\nThere are certain viewpoints that the author, Eliezer Yudkowsky , asserts through the novel that I disagree with - in particular, the notion of death being the main enemy to overcome. Somehow, that seems a somewhat unjustifiable stand from a rational perspective.\nOverall, if you are science nerd but still enjoyed the original Harry Potter series, I think you’ll love this alternate version."

Stepping away from his iconic Los Angeles settings of the Harry Bosch and Mickey Haller novels, Connelly transports readers to Santa Catalina Island, a resort destination twenty-two miles off the coast of California. The novel introduces a new protagonist, Detective Sergeant Stilwell, a formidable investigator exiled to this insular community. Combining the atmospheric tension of a closed-circle mystery with Connelly’s signature procedural realism, “Nightshade” explores the dark underbelly of a picturesque tourist trap."

Stilwell’s hope for a quiet tenure is shattered by two disturbing events: the discovery of a young woman’s body in Avalon Bay and the bizarre beheading of a protected buffalo.\nThe victim, Leigh-Anne Moss, is found weighted down by an anchor and wrapped in a sail bag. She is notable for her dark hair dyed with a purple streak, mimicking the color of the island’s poisonous nightshade flower. While mainland homicide detectives, led by Stilwell’s former rival Ahearn, arrive to take control of the case, they are quick to pursue convenient leads that fit a simple narrative.\nStilwell, adhering to the code that “everybody counts or nobody counts,” refuses to stand down. He conducts a rogue investigation that reveals a connection between the murder and the buffalo mutilation. As he digs deeper, he unearths a conspiracy driven by the island’s powerful elite, including the manager of the exclusive Black Marlin Club and the local Mayor. Their motive is rooted in the preservation of the island’s lucrative tourism economy, which they believe would be threatened by a scandalous murder investigation. Stilwell’s pursuit of the truth exposes a web of corruption, kickbacks, and cover-ups, proving that even in paradise, dangerous secrets fester."

The island is depicted almost as a living character that resists external scrutiny.\nCorruption vs. Justice A central theme is the conflict between economic survival and moral duty. The island’s leaders are willing to obstruct justice to maintain the veneer of a safe tourist haven. The novel questions the cost of prosperity when it requires silencing the truth.\n“Everybody Counts or Nobody Counts” Echoing the moral compass of Harry Bosch, Stilwell champions the forgotten victim. Despite Leigh-Anne Moss’s troubled life and lack of social standing, Stilwell treats her case with the utmost seriousness, reinforcing the idea that justice should not be means-tested."

Despite the hype surrounding AI, creating an intelligence that rivals or exceeds human levels is far more complicated than we have been led to believe. Professors Gary Marcus and Ernest Davis have spent their careers at the forefront of AI research and have witnessed some of the greatest milestones in the field, but they argue that a computer beating a human in Jeopardy! does not signal that we are on the doorstep of fully autonomous cars or superintelligent machines. The achievements in the field thus far have occurred in closed systems with fixed sets of rules, and these approaches are too narrow to achieve genuine intelligence. The real world, in contrast, is wildly complex and open- ended. How can we bridge this gap? What will the consequences be when we do? Taking inspiration from the human mind, Marcus and Davis explain what we need to advance AI to the next level, and suggest that if we are wise along the way, we won’t need to worry about a future of machine overlords. If we focus on endowing machines with common sense and deep understanding, rather than simply focusing on statistical analysis and gathering ever larger collections of data, we will be able to create an AI we can trust– in our homes, our cars, and our doctors’ offices. Rebooting AI provides a lucid, clear-eyed assessment of the current science and offers an inspiring vision of how a new generation of AI can make our lives better.”"

After listening to this audiobook it becomes clear that the ‘purity’ of the Roman Republic was always somewhat precarious.\nThis book introduces characters such as Gaius Marius who was consul an unprecedented seven times and hailed as “the third founder of Rome”, and his nemesis Sulla. We learn of the optimates, supporters of the continued authority of the senate, and populares, those who favoured the cause of the plebeians (the commoners) along with the struggles between the patricians and those considered novus homo (new man).\nThe main downside of the audiobook version is the difficulty in distinguishing between all the different Gaius and Lucius and Quintus characters.\nPublisher’s Description: “The Roman Republic was one of the most remarkable achievements in the history of civilization. After its founding in 509 BCE, Rome grew from an unremarkable Italian city-state to the dominant superpower of the Mediterranean world. Through it all, the Romans never allowed a single man to seize control of the state. Every year for four hundred years the annually elected consuls voluntarily handed power to their successors. Not once did a consul give in to the temptation to grab absolute power and refuse to let it go. It was a run of political self-denial unmatched in the history of the world. The disciplined Roman republicans then proceeded to explode out of Italy and conquer a world filled with petty tyrants, barbarian chieftains, and despotic kings. But the very success of the Republic proved to be its undoing. The republican system was unable to cope with the vast empire Rome ruled. Bankrolled by mountains of imperial wealth and without a foreign enemy to keep them united, ambitious Roman leaders began to stray from the republican austerity of their ancestors. Almost as soon as they had conquered the Mediterranean, Rome would become engulfed in violent political conflicts and civil wars that would destroy the Republic less than a century later. The Storm Before the Storm tells the story of the beginning of the end of the Roman Republic–the story of the first generation that had to cope with the dangerous new political environment made possible by Rome’s unrivaled domination over the known world. The tumultuous years from 133-80 BCE set the stage for the fall of the Republic. The Republic faced issues like rising economic inequality, increasing political polarization, the privatization of the military, endemic social and ethnic prejudice, rampant corruption, ongoing military quagmires, and the ruthless ambition and unwillingness of elites to do anything to reform the system in time to save it–a situation that draws many parallels to present-day America. These issues are among the reasons why the Roman Republic would fall. And as we all know, those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it.”"

And with strange creatures, cunning assassins, and vindictive bankers all plotting his demise, Gorm worries this time the price of doing the right thing will be fatally high. Can he make a saving throw against death with a high-stakes roll at disadvantage? Dragonfired is the thrilling third book in the Dark Profit Saga satirical fantasy trilogy.

Best known for his formulation of the OODA Loop as a model for competitive decision making, Colonel Boyd was also an original thinker in developing tactics for air-to-air combat, designing warplanes, and the fluid, mobile warfare known to the Germans as blitzkrieg and to modern armies as”maneuver warfare.” As much as anyone, John Boyd was the architect of the two great campaigns against Saddam Hussein’s Iraq, both the 1991 liberation of Kuwait and the 2003 “March Up” to Baghdad by the U.S. Army and Marines. But what of the costly, drawn-out insurgency that baffled the invaders once Baghdad had fallen? In this short book, Daniel Ford applies Boyd’s thinking to the problem of counter-insurgency. Unlike the U.S. military in 2003, it turns out that Boyd had indeed put considerable thought into what might transpire after an effective “blitz” campaign. Indeed, he found many similarities between “blitzers” and what he preferred to call guerrillas, and he thought that they might be defeated by turning their own tactics against them. This is an expanded version of a dissertation submitted in the War Studies program at King’s College London.”"

    "text": "Introduction\nIn an era often defined by a “loneliness epidemic,” many individuals operate under the assumption that deep, meaningful connections require grand gestures or dramatic, life-altering events. Jared Matthew Weiss’s The Magic of Tiny Moments: How to Cultivate Love, Friendship, & Community challenges this prevailing narrative. Weiss argues that the true fabric of our relationships—and the quality of our lives—is woven not from massive leaps of faith, but from how we handle the “tiny moments” that present themselves every day. Drawing from behavioral science, neuroscience, and his own qualitative research involving over 10,000 participants across 26 countries, Weiss presents a practical framework for transforming fleeting interactions into lasting bonds [2]."

    "section": "Overview of the Key Points",
    "text": "Overview of the Key Points\nThe core of Weiss’s philosophy is a concept he terms the “Tiny Moment Loop,” which he identifies as the fundamental architecture underlying every human interaction. He posits that the struggle to connect is rarely due to a lack of opportunity, but rather a failure to perceive and utilize the micro-interactions that are constantly available.\nTo navigate this loop effectively, Weiss introduces “The Three Laws of Connection,” a structured approach to interpersonal dynamics:\n\nRecognizing Bids: The first law focuses on awareness. Readers are encouraged to tune into the subtle, often missed attempts others make to connect. These “bids” can be as simple as a comment on the weather or a shared glance, serving as invitations for engagement.\nMaking Generous Assumptions: The second law involves a shift in mindset. Weiss advocates for interpreting the behaviors and intentions of others in the most positive light possible. By assuming good intent, we create an environment of safety and trust that is essential for vulnerability.\nTurning Towards Others: The final law is about action. It requires actively engaging with these bids rather than ignoring them or turning away. By responding with interest and attention, we “close the loop” of connection, validating the other person and strengthening the bond."

    "text": "Overview of the Key Themes\nThe Architecture of Connection A central theme of the book is that relationships are built brick-by-brick through small, safe interactions. Weiss emphasizes that trust is not established overnight but is the result of consistent, positive micro-engagements.\nAwareness and Mindfulness The book stresses the importance of becoming “conscious” of one’s social environment. Many opportunities for connection are lost simply because we are too distracted or preoccupied to notice them. Mindfulness in this context means being present enough to catch the small signals others send our way.\nSelf-Compassion and Forgiveness Weiss acknowledges that human interaction is messy. A significant theme in the book is the necessity of forgiveness—both for others and for oneself. He argues that connecting deeply requires the resolve to move past awkward moments or failed interactions, using them as learning experiences rather than reasons to withdraw.\nEmotional Vocabulary The author also explores the importance of language. Developing a robust emotional vocabulary is presented as a crucial tool for deepening bonds. Being able to articulate feelings clearly helps bridge the gap between intent and impact in relationships with family, friends, and colleagues."

A year has passed since LAPD detective Renée Ballard quit the force in the face of misogyny, demoralization, and endless red tape. Yet, after the chief of police himself tells her she can write her ticket within the department, Ballard takes back her badge, leaving “the Late Show” to rebuild the cold case unit at the elite Robbery-Homicide Division. For years, Harry Bosch has been working a case that haunts him but that he hasn’t been able to crack–the murder of an entire family by a psychopath who still walks free. Ballard makes Bosch an offer: come work with her as a volunteer investigator in the new Open-Unsolved Unit, and he can pursue his “white whale” with the resources of the LAPD behind him. The two must put aside old resentments to work together again and close in on a dangerous killer.

    "text": "Introduction\n“Clown Town” is the ninth installment in Mick Herron’s acclaimed Slough House series, continuing the saga of the “slow horses”—disgraced MI5 agents relegated to administrative purgatory. This novel blends the series’ signature dark humor with high-stakes espionage, delving into the buried secrets of the British intelligence service. In this chapter, the narrative explores the lingering shadows of The Troubles and the personal cost of a life spent in the shadows, as the team at Slough House once again finds themselves the target of political machinations from the Service’s headquarters at Regent’s Park."

    "text": "Overview of the story\nThe narrative unfolds along two converging paths. River Cartwright, currently on medical leave and awaiting clearance to return to active duty, occupies himself by organizing the library of his late grandfather, the legendary spymaster David Cartwright. During this process, River discovers that a “dummy” book—a hollowed-out volume used for concealing sensitive items—is missing. This anomaly triggers River’s instincts, leading him on a private investigation to uncover who infiltrated the O.B.’s (Old Bastard’s) sanctuary and what secrets might have been stolen [1].\nSimultaneously, Diana Taverner, the First Desk at MI5, faces a crisis that threatens her career and the reputation of the Service. A covert operation conducted years ago during the height of The Troubles in Northern Ireland is on the verge of being exposed. Blackmailers are leveraging details of this “ugly side of state security,” forcing Taverner into a corner. In characteristic fashion, Taverner seeks a scapegoat to absorb the fallout, turning her gaze toward the expendable agents of Slough House. However, Jackson Lamb, the slovenly but brilliant leader of the slow horses, intervenes to protect his team from becoming collateral damage in Taverner’s survival strategy [1][2]."

Herron examines how historical operations and the decisions made by a previous generation of spies continue to have dangerous repercussions in the present. The missing item from David Cartwright’s library serves as a physical manifestation of these buried secrets [1].\nThe book also explores the tension between loyalty and expendability. The slow horses are defined by their status as rejects, yet they consistently display a cohesive loyalty to one another that contrasts sharply with the institutional willingness of the Park to sacrifice its own for political expediency. The concept of “old spies” is dissected, questioning the worth of those who have been left behind by history and whether they are merely ridiculous “clowns” or if they retain a dangerous relevancy [2]."

By weaving a mystery about a missing book with a high-level political threat rooted in British history, the novel provides a compelling stage for its ensemble cast. It balances the absurdity of the slow horses’ daily existence with the genuine peril they face, offering a sharp critique of institutional decay while celebrating the resilience of the marginalized agents who operate within it."

My only concerns in life were how to avoid a transfer to the Case Progression Unit - we do paperwork so real coppers don’t have to - and finding a way to climb into the panties of the outrageously perky WPC Leslie May. Then one night, in pursuance of a murder inquiry, I tried to take a witness statement from someone who was dead but disturbingly voluable, and that brought me to the attention of Inspector Nightingale, the last wizard in England. Now I’m a Detective Constable and a trainee wizard, the first apprentice in fifty years, and my world has become somewhat more complicated: nests of vampires in Purley, negotiating a truce between the warring god and goddess of the Thames, and digging up graves in Covent Garden . . . and there’s something festering at the heart of the city I love, a malicious vengeful spirit that takes ordinary Londoners and twists them into grotesque mannequins to act out its drama of violence and despair. The spirit of riot and rebellion has awakened in the city, and it’s falling to me to bring order out of chaos - or die trying.”"

New from the author of Slow Horses, now an Apple Original series from Apple TV+, starring Gary Oldman and Kristin Scott Thomas. Two years ago, a hostile Prime Minister launched the Monochrome inquiry, investigating “historical over-reaching” by the British Secret Service. Monochrome’s mission was to ferret out any hint of misconduct by any MI5 officer—and allowed Griselda Fleet and Malcolm Kyle, the two civil servants seconded to the project, unfettered access to any and all confidential information in the Service archives in order to do so. But MI5’s formidable First Desk did not become Britain’s top spy by accident, and she has successfully thwarted the inquiry at every turn. Now the administration that created Monochrome has been ousted, the investigation is a total bust—and Griselda and Malcolm are stuck watching as their career prospects are washed away by the pounding London rain. Until the eve of Monochrome’s shuttering, when an MI5 case file appears without explanation. It is the buried history of a classified operation in 1994 Berlin—an operation that ended in tragedy and scandal, whose cover-up has rewritten thirty years of Service history. The Secret Hours is a dazzling entry point into Mick Herron’s body of work, a standalone spy thriller that is at once unnerving, poignant, and laugh-out- loud funny. It is also the breathtaking secret history that Slough House fans have been waiting for."

What should we do, or leave undone, in a day or a lifetime? How much messiness should we accept? What balance of new activities and familiar favorites is the most fulfilling? These may seem like uniquely human quandaries, but they are not: computers, too, face the same constraints, so computer scientists have been grappling with their version of such issues for decades. And the solutions they’ve found have much to teach us. In a dazzlingly interdisciplinary work, acclaimed author Brian Christian and cognitive scientist Tom Griffiths show how the algorithms used by computers can also untangle very human questions. They explain how to have better hunches and when to leave things to chance, how to deal with overwhelming choices and how best to connect with others. From finding a spouse to finding a parking spot, from organizing one’s inbox to understanding the workings of memory, Algorithms to Live By transforms the wisdom of computer science into strategies for human living.”"

Jacobs, bestselling author of The Puzzler In 2021 cryptocurrency went mainstream. Giant investment funds were buying it, celebrities like Tom Brady endorsed it, and TV ads hailed it as the future of money. Hardly anyone knew how it worked—but why bother with the particulars when everyone was making a fortune from Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, or some other bizarrely named “digital asset”? As he observed this frenzy, investigative reporter Zeke Faux had a nagging question: Was it all just a confidence game of epic proportions? What started as curiosity—with a dash of FOMO—would morph into a two-year, globe-spanning quest to understand the wizards behind the world’s new financial machinery. Faux’s investigation would lead him to a schlubby, frizzy-haired twenty-nine-year-old named Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF for short) and a host of other crypto scammers, utopians, and overnight billionaires. Faux follows the trail to a luxury resort in the Bahamas, where SBF boldly declares that he will use his crypto fortune to save the world. Faux talks his way onto the yacht of a former child actor turned crypto impresario and gains access to “ApeFest,” an elite party headlined by Snoop Dogg, by purchasing a $20,000 image of a cartoon monkey. In El Salvador, Faux learns what happens when a country wagers its treasury on Bitcoin, and in the Philippines, he stumbles upon a Pokémon knockoff mobile game touted by boosters as a cure for poverty. And in an astonishing development, a spam text leads Faux to Cambodia, where he uncovers a crypto-powered human-trafficking ring. When the bubble suddenly bursts in “2022”, Faux brings readers inside SBF’s penthouse as the fallen crypto king faces his imminent arrest. Fueled by the absurd details and authoritative reporting that earned Zeke Faux the accolade “our great poet of crime” (Money Stuff columnist Matt Levine), Number Go Up is the essential chronicle, by turns harrowing and uproarious, of a $3 trillion financial delusion."

But before long, he can’t deny it: Something’s happening to his brain. To his body. He’s starting to see the world, and those around him—even those he loves most—in whole new ways.

Because of his new abilities, Logan’s the one person in the world capable of stopping what’s been set in motion.

The book offers a comprehensive look at Abedin’s life, tracing her journey from a multicultural upbringing in Saudi Arabia and the United States to the corridors of power in Washington, D.C. The title, “Both/And,” encapsulates Abedin’s central philosophy: the refusal to choose between conflicting identities. She posits that one can be both American and Muslim, a dedicated public servant and a devoted mother, and a private individual thrust into the public eye. The memoir serves as an insider’s account of historic political moments while also detailing the deeply personal challenges she faced, including the public unraveling of her marriage to Anthony Weiner [1][3]."

    "text": "Overview of the Key Points\nAbedin’s narrative begins with her childhood, born in Michigan to intellectual parents of Indian and Pakistani descent. At the age of two, her family moved to Saudi Arabia, where she spent the school years in Jeddah while returning to the U.S. for summers. This upbringing, straddling two distinct cultures, laid the foundation for her ability to navigate diverse viewpoints and worlds [3].\nHer professional journey commenced in 1996 with an internship at the White House, assigned to the First Lady’s office. This pivotal moment marked the start of her decades-long mentorship and partnership with Hillary Clinton. The book details her ascent from a personal aide, often referred to as a “body woman,” to Deputy Chief of Staff at the State Department and Vice Chair of Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign. Through these roles, Abedin provides a behind-the-scenes look at the grueling demands of high-stakes politics and the intense loyalty required to survive in that environment [1][3].\nA significant portion of the memoir addresses her tumultuous marriage to former Congressman Anthony Weiner. She recounts their courtship, the birth of their son, Jordan, and the subsequent “sexting” scandals that not only destroyed Weiner’s political career but also placed Abedin under intense scrutiny. She writes candidly about the pain of betrayal, the media frenzy, and the FBI investigation into her emails found on Weiner’s laptop—an event that arguably impacted the outcome of the 2016 presidential election [3].\nFollowing the 2016 election loss, the narrative focuses on the aftermath and her path toward independence. Abedin describes the dissolution of her marriage and her journey to define herself outside of her relationships with powerful figures, emphasizing a process of healing and self-discovery [3]."

    "text": "Overview of the Key Themes\nThe central theme of the book is the concept of “Both/And”—the rejection of binary choices in favor of embracing multiplicity. Abedin explores the complexity of her identity, arguing that her faith as a Muslim and her patriotism as an American are not mutually exclusive but rather complementary forces. She discusses how her faith provides a moral compass and a source of strength, challenging common stereotypes [3].\nLoyalty and service are also pervasive themes. Abedin portrays her dedication to Hillary Clinton and her work in government not just as a career, but as a form of duty and service. This loyalty is tested but remains a core tenet of her character. Resilience is another key element, illustrated by her ability to compartmentalize personal trauma—specifically the public humiliation of her husband’s scandals—to continue her professional duties with grace [3].\nFinally, motherhood emerges as a grounding force. Her relationship with her son, Jordan, is depicted as an anchor that drives her perseverance through the darkest moments of scandal and political defeat, motivating her to survive and rebuild [3]."

The final message is one of moving forward with grace, embracing the complexities of her life without letting her mistakes or circumstances define her [1][3]."

    "text": "Introduction\nGet In: The Inside Story of Labour Under Starmer, co-authored by Patrick Maguire and Gabriel Pogrund, offers a definitive, behind-the-scenes account of the Labour Party’s transformation from its historic defeat in 2019 to its landslide election victory in 2024. The narrative focuses less on Keir Starmer himself and more on the machinery and operatives behind him, particularly his chief of staff and campaign director, Morgan McSweeney [1]. The book portrays McSweeney as the central protagonist and a “modern-day Machiavelli” who orchestrated a ruthless and disciplined operation to rebuild the party as a merciless vote-winning machine [1]. It argues that this period marks a shift from the “Blair/Brown” era, where leaders drove strategy, to a new model where the political machine drives the leader [1]."

    "section": "Overview of the Key Points",
    "text": "Overview of the Key Points\nThe book details several significant revelations about the internal workings of the Labour Party during this period. One of the most striking disclosures is Keir Starmer’s “wobble” following the humiliating Hartlepool by-election defeat in 2021. The authors reveal that Starmer was distraught and told close aides, “I think I have to go… We’re going backwards,” bringing him to the brink of resignation before being persuaded to stay [1].\nAnother key aspect of the narrative is the role of Labour Together, McSweeney’s organization. The book describes it as starting as a “confidence trick” designed to destabilize Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership from within while masquerading as a benign think tank [1]. This operation culminated in strategic maneuvers such as the 2021 party conference rule changes, which are characterized as a secretly planned “ambush” intended to permanently weaken the left wing of the party [1].\nThe dynamic between Starmer and his aides is also a major focus. Sources in the book describe Starmer as sometimes acting like a “pawn in a chess game” or a “driverless train” controlled by his strategists, with one aide remarking that he acts “like an HR manager, not a leader” [1]. The book also chronicles the brutal internal power struggle between McSweeney and Starmer’s former Chief of Staff, Sue Gray, depicting Gray as a “power-hoarding control freak” who was ultimately outmaneuvered [1]. Additionally, it is suggested that Starmer’s 2020 leadership campaign pledges were ghostwritten and viewed merely as tools to win the leadership rather than binding principles [1]."

    "section": "Overview of the Key Themes",
    "text": "Overview of the Key Themes\nRuthlessness and the Pursuit of Power The “single all-consuming principle” of the Starmer project is identified as winning. The book illustrates how promises and principles were readily discarded if they were perceived as hindrances to electoral success [1].\nBetrayal of the Left A recurring theme is the deliberate and systematic dismantling of the Corbynite faction. The strategists viewed the left wing not just as political opponents within the party, but as an existential threat that needed to be “eviscerated” to ensure the party’s survival and electability [1].\nThe Machine vs. The Leader The book explores the shift in political power dynamics, showing how the political operative (McSweeney) held as much, if not more, strategic agency than the elected leader (Starmer). This highlights a new era of political management where the “machine” is paramount [1].\nDiscipline over Democracy The transformation of the Labour Party is shown to rely heavily on tight control, secrecy, and the marginalization of internal dissent. The narrative suggests that the path to victory was paved by prioritizing strict party discipline over broad internal democracy [1]."

It presents a party that successfully clawed its way back from irrelevance through cold calculation and the relentless drive of its backroom staff. While it chronicles a successful path to power, it also raises questions about the cost of that success in terms of internal democracy and ideological consistency."

    "text": "Plot Summary and Story Arc\nThe story begins with the appointment of Ellen Adams as Secretary of State by the newly inaugurated President Douglas Williams. The relationship between the two is strained; they were bitter rivals during the primaries, and Adams views the appointment as a political move designed to neutralize her by assigning her a failing portfolio. The previous administration, led by the isolationist President Eric Dunn, has left America’s standing on the world stage diminished and its diplomatic corps hollowed out.\nThe inciting incident occurs when Anahita Dahir, a junior Foreign Service Officer, receives a baffling, coded email. Shortly thereafter, a bomb detonates on a bus in London. While the world reacts to the immediate tragedy, Adams uncovers a disturbing pattern suggesting this is merely the opening move of a larger conspiracy. The plot follows Adams as she travels from London to Paris and Frankfurt, attempting to unravel a web of deceit that implicates not only foreign extremists but also domestic elements.\nThe central antagonist is Bashir Shah, a Pakistani arms dealer who has acquired nuclear capabilities. The narrative reveals that during the “Dunn” administration, the U.S. withdrawal from global agreements created a power vacuum that allowed Shah to operate unchecked. The threat escalates when it becomes clear that three nuclear devices exist. The story arc transforms into a race against time as Adams and her team—including her close friend and counselor Betsy Jameson—attempt to locate the warheads before they are detonated in American cities.\nThe climax takes place on American soil, where the final nuclear threat must be neutralized. The resolution involves high-stakes diplomacy, military intervention, and the exposure of treasonous actors within the U.S. government who colluded with foreign enemies for political gain."

    "text": "Character Development\n\nEllen Adams: As the protagonist, Adams is depicted as a pragmatic, resilient, and intellectually formidable figure. While she shares obvious biographical parallels with Clinton, she is established as a distinct character—a widow and media executive turned politician. Her development is defined by her transition from a political outsider within the administration to an indispensable partner to the President. She is frequently underestimated by her male counterparts, a recurring dynamic she navigates with weary competence.\nBetsy Jameson: Modeled after Clinton’s real-life friend Betsy Ebeling, Jameson serves as Adams’s emotional anchor and unofficial advisor. She provides a sounding board for the Secretary, offering plain-spoken wisdom that cuts through diplomatic jargon. Her presence underscores the narrative’s focus on the necessity of trusted inner circles.\nPresident Douglas Williams: Initially presented as an antagonist to Adams, Williams evolves significantly. The narrative arc sees him move from political posturing to genuine statesmanship. The thawing of relations between Williams and Adams—from mutual suspicion to a forged alliance—is a central character dynamic, symbolizing the unification of a fractured government.\nAnahita Dahir: Representing the career civil servants, Dahir’s journey from an overlooked junior officer to a key player in saving the country highlights the importance of the institutional knowledge held by the “Deep State” bureaucracy."

    "section": "Key Themes and Messages",
    "text": "Key Themes and Messages\n\nThe Fragility of Democracy and Alliances\nThe novel argues that American security is inextricably linked to its engagement with the world. The authors critique isolationism, portraying the fictional “Dunn” administration’s “America First” policies as the direct cause of the terror threat. The book suggests that stepping back from global leadership creates vacuums filled by opportunists and terrorists.\n\n\nThe Reality of Governance\nClinton and Penny emphasize the unglamorous, grinding nature of high-level diplomacy. Unlike thrillers that rely solely on action heroes, State of Terror focuses on the logistical nightmares, jet lag, and intricate protocol involved in international relations.\n\n“What was the point of having power if you didn’t use it? To make things better. To fix what was broken. To heal the sick. To bridge the divide.”\n\n\n\nDomestic Betrayal\nA significant theme is the danger posed by domestic political polarization. The novel posits that the greatest threat to the nation is not always external terrorism, but internal division and the willingness of political actors to sabotage the country for personal power. The text reflects on how hyper-partisanship creates vulnerabilities that foreign adversaries exploit.\n\n\nWomen in Power\nThe narrative frequently addresses the specific challenges faced by women in high office, including scrutiny of their appearance and the dismissal of their intuition. The bond between Ellen and Betsy illustrates the theme of female solidarity as a survival mechanism in a male-dominated environment.\nThe book concludes with the immediate crisis averted, but with a sobering acknowledgement of the continued vigilance required to maintain national security and democratic stability."

Grieving her best friend’s recent death, neuroscientist Mariana Pineda’s ready to give up everything to start anew. Even her career–after one last week consulting at a top secret particle accelerator. Except the strangest thing happens: a man stops her…and claims they’ve met before. Carter Cho knows who she is, why she’s mourning, why she’s there. And he needs Mariana to remember everything he’s saying. Because time is about to loop. In a flash of energy, it’s Monday morning. Again. Together, Mariana and Carter enter an inevitable life, four days at a time, over and over, without permanence except for what they share. With everything resetting–even bank accounts–joy comes in the little moments: a delicious (and expensive) meal, a tennis match, giving a dog his favorite treat. In some ways, those are all that matter. But just as they figure out this new life, everything changes. Because Carter’s memories of the time loop are slowly disappearing. And their only chance at happiness is breaking out of the loop–forever."

Published in 2025, this novel serves as a sequel to Beaumont’s debut, “A Spy Alone,” and continues the story of Simon Sharman. Set against the backdrop of the early months of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the book combines a gritty, on-the-ground war narrative with a high-stakes mole hunt within the British establishment. The author utilizes his professional background to infuse the narrative with authentic tradecraft, moving the genre away from Cold War nostalgia toward the realities of modern hybrid warfare and geopolitical influence operations [1]."

    "text": "Overview of the story\nThe narrative takes place in August 2022, a volatile period following Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The protagonist, Simon Sharman, is a disgraced former MI6 officer operating outside the boundaries of official sanction. Driven by a personal vendetta, Sharman travels to the frontlines of the conflict—from Kyiv to the devastated city of Bakhmut—to hunt down Chovka Buchayev, a sadistic Chechen mercenary commander responsible for the murder of Sharman’s former partner, Evie [2].\nAs Sharman navigates the physical dangers of the war zone, a parallel and equally dangerous conflict unfolds in London. The “Oxford Spy Ring,” a network of Russian moles embedded deep within the British political class, is actively working to undermine Western support for Ukraine. Sharman discovers that the enemy is not just on the battlefield but also in the corridors of Whitehall, where compromised officials and advisors manipulate policy to favor Moscow. The plot interweaves these two theaters of war, forcing Sharman to dismantle the domestic threat while surviving the kinetic violence of the Donbas [1] [2]."

The novel critiques how financial corruption and political lobbying allow hostile states to buy influence in London. It moves beyond the idea of spies stealing secrets to show them manipulating policy and public opinion through “useful idiots” in the establishment [1].\nInstitutional Betrayal and Hypocrisy: Beaumont explores the moral failures of Western institutions. The antagonist is not just a foreign enemy but the corruption within the British system itself—officials who prioritize career advancement or financial gain over national security.\nRevenge versus Duty: Sharman is torn between his personal desire to avenge his partner and the strategic necessity of neutralizing the spy ring. The novel examines the cost of intelligence work on the individual soul and the difficulty of finding justice in a world of gray moralities."

    "text": "Money - The True Story Of A Made-Up Thing by Jacob Goldstein\n\n\nisbn-13: 9780316417198\nAudible\nPublisher’s Description: “Co-host of the popular NPR podcast”Planet Money” provides a well- researched, entertaining, somewhat irreverent look at how money is a made- up thing that has evolved over time to suit humanity’s changing needs. What is money anyway, and where and why did it originate? According to Jacob Goldstein, this made-up thing has evolved over centuries and takes different forms based on technological advances, the needs of society, and often the crazy ideas of outliers on the fringes. Told through witty, historical anecdotes, Goldstein demystifies this ever-evolving tool from the invention of the first coins in Mesopotamia, to how China invented paper money centuries before it appeared in the west, how at one point in Sweden men carried giant “coins” on their backs to pay for goods, to the gold standard, pound sterling, origins of the Euro, mutual funds, bitcoin and a cashless society. Money presents entertaining tales of fascinating characters who fundamentally changed our monetary systems such as Genghis Khan, John Law, a convicted murderer and professional gambler, the Luddites, and the anarchist cyberpunks who created bitcoin. Through these major movements we see the rise and fall of various financial institutions: central banks, the stock market, the Federal Reserve, and the shadow institutions like Lehman Brothers that helped create the financial crisis of 2008. Lively and accessible and full of interesting tidbits (the word “banker” comes from the Venetian “bench sitters”-or “banchieri”-of the 1600s who guarded the gold) Goldstein looks at the evolution of money (whose definition appears to be, if we all agree it’s money, then it is money) and confronts its true purpose and who it is supposed to be for.”"

It resonated with me on many levels, as someone growing up a Muslim in a “western” environment and also as a parent trying to raise my children in a Muslim home and pass on Islamic values. But really the book is about growing up and family and community and belonging - universal themes, just set in the context of Indian Shia Muslim couple who have created a new life and raised a family in America.\nThe both slowly cycles through different narrators, with the reader gaining additional insight when we see the events through the eyes of a different character. Particularly poignant for me was the final viewpoint we get from the father, Rafiq, and how we tries to act with love but almost everything he does is interpeted in a different way by his son Amar.\nHighly recommended.\nPublisher’s Description: “AN INSTANT NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • NATIONAL BOOK AWARD “5 UNDER 35” NOMINEE • NEW YORK’S “ONE BOOK, ONE NEW YORK” PICK Named One of the Best Books of the Year: Washington Post • NPR • People • Refinery29 • Parade • BuzzFeed “Mirza writes with a mercy that encompasses all things.”—Ron Charles, Washington Post Hailed as “a book for our times” (Christiane Amanpour), A Place for Us is a deeply moving and resonant story of love, identity, and belonging. As an Indian wedding gathers a family back together, parents Rafiq and Layla must reckon with the choices their children have made. There is Hadia: their headstrong, eldest daughter, whose marriage is a match of love and not tradition. Huda, the middle child, determined to follow in her sister’s footsteps. And lastly, their estranged son, Amar, who returns to the family fold for the first time in three years to take his place as brother of the bride. What secrets and betrayals have caused this close-knit family to fracture? Can Amar find his way back to the people who know and love him best? A Place for Us takes us back to the beginning of this family’s life: from the bonds that bring them together, to the differences that pull them apart. All the joy and struggle of family life is here, from Rafiq and Layla’s own arrival in America from India, to the years in which their children—each in their own way—tread between two cultures, seeking to find their place in the world, as well as a path home. A Place for Us is a book for our times: an astonishingly tender-hearted novel of identity and belonging, and a resonant portrait of what it means to be an American family today. It announces Fatima Farheen Mirza as a major new literary talent.”"

    "text": "Tracers in the Dark: The Global Hunt for the Crime Lords of Cryptocurrency by Andy Greenberg\n\n\nisbn-13: 9780385548090\nAudible\nPublisher’s Description\nFrom the award-winning author of Sandworm comes the propulsive story of a new breed of investigators who have cracked the Bitcoin blockchain, exposing once-anonymous realms of money, drugs, and violence. “A gripping, stranger-than-fiction tale of how a small team of geeks and federal agents cracked what was once thought to be untraceable cryptocurrency.” —Garrett M. Graff, New York Times bestselling author of The Only Plane in the Sky and Watergate Over the last decade, a single innovation has massively fueled digital black markets: cryptocurrency. Crime lords inhabiting lawless corners of the internet have operated more freely—whether in drug dealing, money laundering, or human trafficking—than their analog counterparts could have ever dreamed of. By transacting not in dollars or pounds but in currencies with anonymous ledgers, overseen by no government, beholden to no bankers, these black marketeers have sought to rob law enforcement of their chief method of cracking down on illicit finance: following the money. But what if the centerpiece of this dark economy held a secret, fatal flaw? What if their currency wasn’t so cryptic after all? An investigator using the right mixture of technical wizardry, financial forensics, and old-fashioned persistence could uncover an entire world of wrongdoing. Tracers in the Dark is a story of crime and pursuit unlike any other. With unprecedented access to the major players in federal law enforcement and private industry, veteran cybersecurity reporter Andy Greenberg tells an astonishing saga of criminal empires built and destroyed. He introduces an IRS agent with a defiant streak, a Bitcoin- tracing Danish entrepreneur, and a colorful ensemble of hardboiled agents and prosecutors as they delve deep into the crypto-underworld. The result is a thrilling, globe-spanning story of dirty cops, drug bazaars, trafficking rings, and the biggest takedown of an online narcotics market in the history of the Internet. Utterly of our time, Tracers in the Dark is a cat-and-mouse story and a tale of a technological one-upmanship. Filled with canny maneuvering and shocking twists, it answers a provocative question: How would some of the world’s most brazen criminals behave if they were sure they could never get caught?"

The worked through examples are simple ones and although it does mention real-life problems that were solved using Bayes Theorem it doesnt walk through the application of the theorem in any detail for these cases. This is fair enough as it does state that it’s an introduction for beginners, as the book is succesful in that stated goal."

I really enjoyed Adam Grant’s Give and Take and I like his style of writing and exposition. He strikes a nice balance between Gladwell’s journalistic narrative style and a more academic style.\nOne criticism I had of Give and Take was that it was hard to draw convert into actions for change. This book however ends with 30 actionable tips for rethinking.\nThis book is about how we change ideas and viewpoints: our own, other people’s and those of organizations and communities collectively. The both has three main parts that organized along those lines: Individual Rethinking, Interpersonal Rethinking Collective Rethinking."

    "section": "Part I. Individual Rethinking",
    "text": "Part I. Individual Rethinking\nHere Grant introduces the analogy of the ‘Preacher, Prosecutor, Politician and Scientist’ mindsets. Not surprisingly, he advocates the Scientist mindset as the way to change your beliefs as new evidence is uncovered.\n\nAs we thìnk and talk, we often slip into the mindsets of three different professions: preachers, prosecutors, and politicians, In each of these modes, we take on a particular identity and use a distinct set of tools. We go into preacher mode when our sacred beliefs are in jeopardy: we deliver sermons to protect and promote our ideals. We enter prosecutor mode when we recognize flaws in other people’s reasoning: we marshal arguments to prove them wrong and win our case. We shift into politician mode when we’re seeking to win over an audience: we campaign and lobby for the approvall of our constituents. The risk is that we become so wrapped up im preaching that we’re right, prosecuting others who are wrong, and politicking for support that we don’t bother to rethink our own views.\n\n\nBut being a scientist is not just a profession. It’s a frame of mind - a mode of thinking that differs from preaching, prosecuting, and politicking. We move into scientist mode when we’re searching for the truth: we run experiments to test hypotheses and discover knowledge. Scientific tools aren’t reserved for people with white coats and beakers, and using them doesn’t require toiling away for years with a microscope and a petri dish. Hypotheses have as much of a place in our lives as they do in the lab. Experiments can inform our daily decisions.\n\nHe also explores confidence, humility, impostor syndrome and finding joy in being wrong.\n\n…feeling like an impostor can make us better learners. Having some doubts about our knowledge and skills takes us off a pedestal, encouraging us to seek out insights from others. As psychologist Elizabeth Krumrei Mancuso and her colleagues write, “Learning requires the humility to realize one has something to learn.”"

    "section": "Part II. Interpersonal Rethinking",
    "text": "Part II. Interpersonal Rethinking\nThe big takeaway for me in this part was the chapter on Motivational Interviewing.\n\nWhen we’re trying to persuade people, we frequently take an adversarial approach. Instead of opening their minds, we effectively shut them down or rile them up. They play defense by putting up a shield, play offense by preaching their perspectives and prosecuting ours, or play politics by telling us what we want to hear without changing what they actually think.\n\n\nMotivational interviewing starts with an attitude of humility and curiosity. We don’t know what might motivate someone else to change, but we’re genuinely eager to find out. The goal isn’t to tell people what to do; it’s to help them break out of overconfidence cycles and see new possibilities. Our role is to hold up a mirror so they can see themselves more clearly, and then empower them to examine their beliefs and behaviors. That can activate a rethinking cycle, in which people approach their own views more scientifically. They develop more humility about their knowledge, doubt in their convictions, and curiosity about alternative points of view.\n\n\nThe process of motivational interviewing involves three key techniques: - Asking open-ended questions - Engaging in reflective listening - Affirming the person’s desire and ability to change\n\n\nWhen people ignore advice, it isn’t always because they disagree with it. Sometimes they’re resisting the sense of pressure and the feeling that someone else is controlling their decision.\n\n\nPsychologists have found that when people detect an attempt at influence, they have sophisticated defense mechanisms. The moment people feel that we’re trying to persuade them, our behavior takes on a different meaning. A straightforward question is seen as a political tactic, a reflective listening statement comes across as a prosecutor’s maneuvering, an affirmation of their ability to change sounds like a preacher’s proselytizing."

This is the right book for right now. Yes, learning requires focus. But, unlearning and relearning requires much more—it requires choosing courage over comfort. In Think Again, Adam Grant weaves together research and storytelling to help us build the intellectual and emotional muscle we need to stay curious enough about the world to actually change it. I’ve never felt so hopeful about what I don’t know.” —Brené Brown, Ph.D., #1 New York Times bestselling author of Dare to Lead The bestselling author of Give and Take and Originals examines the critical art of rethinking: learning to question your opinions and open other people’s minds, which can position you for excellence at work and wisdom in life Intelligence is usually seen as the ability to think and learn, but in a rapidly changing world, there’s another set of cognitive skills that might matter more: the ability to rethink and unlearn. In our daily lives, too many of us favor the comfort of conviction over the discomfort of doubt. We listen to opinions that make us feel good, instead of ideas that make us think hard. We see disagreement as a threat to our egos, rather than an opportunity to learn. We surround ourselves with people who agree with our conclusions, when we should be gravitating toward those who challenge our thought process. The result is that our beliefs get brittle long before our bones. We think too much like preachers defending our sacred beliefs, prosecutors proving the other side wrong, and politicians campaigning for approval–and too little like scientists searching for truth. Intelligence is no cure, and it can even be a curse: being good at thinking can make us worse at rethinking. The brighter we are, the blinder to our own limitations we can become. Organizational psychologist Adam Grant is an expert on opening other people’s minds–and our own. As Wharton’s top-rated professor and the bestselling author of Originals and Give and Take, he makes it one of his guiding principles to argue like he’s right but listen like he’s wrong. With bold ideas and rigorous evidence, he investigates how we can embrace the joy of being wrong, bring nuance to charged conversations, and build schools, workplaces, and communities of lifelong learners. You’ll learn how an international debate champion wins arguments, a Black musician persuades white supremacists to abandon hate, a vaccine whisperer convinces concerned parents to immunize their children, and Adam has coaxed Yankees fans to root for the Red Sox. Think Again reveals that we don’t have to believe everything we think or internalize everything we feel. It’s an invitation to let go of views that are no longer serving us well and prize mental flexibility over foolish consistency. If knowledge is power, knowing what we don’t know is wisdom.”"

The difference is that nobody ended up profiting from it. Although much blame is rightfully placed on the Trump administration’s lack of interest in public health - they dismantled the pandemic response unit that the George W. Bush administration had created and that the Obama administration maintained - above all, this book is a sweeping indictment of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and their inaction throughout the crisis.\nThe book points to systemic issues with the way public health is administered in the US and a sort of institutionalized cowardice at the heart of those systems.\nLots of potential heroes do surface in Lewis’ telling of our Pandemic story but a lot of the time they are just not listened to.\nHighly recommended.\nPublisher’s Description: “For those who could read between the lines, the censored news out of China was terrifying.

    "text": "Introduction\n“Being Jewish After the Destruction of Gaza: A Reckoning” by Peter Beinart is a political and theological critique published in early 2025. In this work, Beinart addresses the profound moral crisis facing the Jewish community in the wake of the events of October 7 and the subsequent war in Gaza. He argues that the dominant narrative of Jewish life—one rooted primarily in the memory of persecution and the status of the “virtuous victim”—has become a dangerous blinder. This narrative, he contends, obscures the reality of Jewish power and the suffering inflicted by the State of Israel. The book serves as a call for a “new story” of Jewish identity, one that refuses to idolize the state and instead prioritizes human equality and justice as the true expression of Jewish tradition [1] [2]."

    "section": "Overview of the Key Points",
    "text": "Overview of the Key Points\nBeinart structures his argument around the necessity of shifting from a defensive posture of survival to an ethical posture of accountability.\nThe Failure of the “Old Story” Beinart posits that the traditional Jewish narrative, which focuses exclusively on historical trauma and the threat of annihilation, is no longer sufficient or moral in an era of Jewish sovereignty. He suggests that viewing every conflict through the lens of the Holocaust allows the community to justify actions—such as mass starvation or bombardment in Gaza—that would otherwise be unconscionable. By clinging to the identity of the permanent victim, the community fails to recognize when it has become the victimizer [1].\nRe-reading Sacred Texts A significant portion of the book is dedicated to re-interpreting Jewish texts to highlight the complexities of power. Beinart points to the Book of Esther, traditionally celebrated during Purim as a story of survival against a genocidal decree. He highlights the often-overlooked conclusion of the story, where the Jews preemptively massacre their enemies. By engaging with these difficult passages, Beinart illustrates that the potential for violence and domination has always existed within the tradition, and ignoring it leads to moral failure [2].\nThe Idolatry of the State Beinart draws on the concept of Avodah Zarah (idolatry) to critique the modern relationship between the Jewish diaspora and Israel. He argues that for many, the State of Israel has ceased to be a political instrument for safety and has instead become an object of worship. Citing thinkers like Yeshayahu Leibowitz, he warns that elevating a nation-state to something holy inevitably leads to the desecration of human life, as the preservation of the state becomes more important than the values it was meant to protect [2]."

    "section": "Overview of the Key Themes",
    "text": "Overview of the Key Themes\n\nVictimhood vs. Responsibility\nThe central theme of the book is the tension between historical Jewish vulnerability and contemporary Jewish power. Beinart challenges the notion that safety requires supremacy. He argues that the “survival at any cost” mentality has created a moral blind spot, preventing an honest reckoning with the destruction of Gaza. He proposes that true safety for both Israelis and Palestinians can only be achieved through mutual equality rather than domination [3].\n\n\nUniversalism vs. Particularism\nBeinart navigates the conflict between Jewish particularism (loyalty to one’s own tribe) and universal human rights. He advocates for a return to a universalist ethic, suggesting that Jewish values are best expressed when they are applied to all human beings, not just Jews. He critiques the insulation of the Jewish community, arguing that a morality that stops at the borders of one’s own group is ultimately hollow [1].\n\n\nThe Corruption of Identity\nThe book explores how the uncritical support of Israeli policies has corrupted Jewish identity in the Diaspora. Beinart describes a “nightmare scenario” where the Jewish state mirrors historical colonial powers in its displacement of native populations. He fears that by tethering Jewish identity so tightly to state power, the community risks losing its ethical core [1]."

He asserts that the current path—defined by an indefinite occupation and the rationalization of mass suffering—is unsustainable both politically and spiritually. The “reckoning” he calls for is a decoupling of Jewish identity from the machinery of the state. He envisions a future where Jews define themselves not by their ability to dominate a specific territory, but by their commitment to the flourishing of all people, implying that the liberation of Palestinians is inextricably linked to the redemption of Judaism itself [2] [3]."

    "text": "Alchemy by Rory Sutherland\n\n\nisbn-13: 9780062388414\nAudible\nPublisher’s Description:\n“The legendary advertising guru—Ogilvy UK’s vice chairman—and star of three massively popular TED Talks, blends the science of human behavior with his vast experience in the art of persuasion in this incomparable book that decodes successful branding and marketing in the vein of Freakonomics, Thinking Fast and Slow, and The Power of Habit. When Rory Sutherland was a trainee working on a direct mail campaign at the famed advertising firm OgilvyOne, he noticed that very small changes in design often had immense effects on the number of consumer responses. Yet no one he worked with knew why. Sutherland began taking stock of each effective yet nebulous trick—”the thing which has no name”—he discovered. As he rose in the advertising industry, he began to understand why these things had no name: no one was interested in quantifying them, cataloguing them, or really investigating them. So, he did it himself. Like classic behavioral economists Daniel Kahneman and Richard Thaler, Sutherland peels away hidden, often irrational human behaviors that explain how the world around us functions. In How to Be an Alchemist he examines why certain ads work and the broader truths they tell us about who we are. Why do people prefer stripy toothpaste, and how might that help us design retirement plans that young people would actually buy? Why do we think orange juice is healthy, and how does the same principle guide our feelings about nuclear reactors? Why do budget airlines advertise services they don’t offer—and what might insurance companies learn from them about keeping healthcare costs low? Filled with startling and profound conclusions, Sutherland’s journey through the world of advertising and its surprising lessons for human behavior is insightful, brilliant, eye-opening, and irresistibly fun.”"

It turned out to be a great read and very thought provoking.\nGrant postulates that people fall in to three distinct categories of interpersonal dealing: Takers, Matchers and Givers. Takers take more than they give, Matchers give and take proportionally and conditionally, Givers give more than they take. According to the book, long-lasting success accrues to givers more than to takers or matchers. I liked the book and it had some great stories; my only negative is that its hard to pinpoint many concrete takeaways on how to behave differently. Also, I would imagine few people self-identify as takers (or even matchers) so there’s a temptation for people to come away from reading the book feeling good about being a giver and not really changing anything as a result."

    "text": "Mistakes Were Made (But Not by Me) by Carol Tavris, Elliot Aronson - (Kindle)\n\n\nThis was a truly eye-opening deep dive into cognitive dissonance theory and its by-product self-justification. Although I was generally familiar with the term ‘cognitive dissonance’ I had not been exposed to cognitive dissonance theory in any detail. Having read this book, the world we live in today and, in particular, the fact that so many people hold beliefs that seem completely contradictory to clear facts, is much more understandable. - Cognitive dissonance is a state of tension that occurs whenever a person holds two cognitions (ideas, attitudes, beliefs, opinions) that are psychologically inconsistent, such as “Smoking is a dumb thing to do because it could kill me” and “I smoke two packs a day.” - Dissonance produces mental discomfort, ranging from minor pangs to deep anguish; people don’t rest easy until they find a way to reduce it. - Self-justification is the usual mechanism by which people reduce dissonance. People become more certain about something they just did if they can’t undo it or if it came at some cost (time, money, effort etc). Information that is consonant with their belief / decision is accepted and conflicting information is considered biased. The first few chapters discuss the pyschology and scientific behaviour and how the brain and memory works. The rest of the book dives into specific examples of how self-justification manifests itself. The chapters on false memory and innocent people convicted of crimes are particularly powerful. A by-product of reading this book (at elast for me) is that it makes you examine your own deeply-held beliefs and look for evidence of self-justification. The challenge is that we are often blind to the lies we tell and have told ourselves so that self-justification may be very difficult to perceive."

Fortunately, this dose won’t cause a temporary fever—and it happens to be a rippingly good read.” —Wired “This crisply written and well-paced book reads like an all-caps warning for a world shackled to the machines we carry in our pockets and place on our laps . . .” —The Washington Post From two former military officers and award-winning authors, a chillingly authentic geopolitical thriller that imagines a naval clash between the US and China in the South China Sea in 2034—and the path from there to a nightmarish global conflagration. On March 12, 2034, US Navy Commodore Sarah Hunt is on the bridge of her flagship, the guided missile destroyer USS John Paul Jones, conducting a routine freedom of navigation patrol in the South China Sea when her ship detects an unflagged trawler in clear distress, smoke billowing from its bridge. On that same day, US Marine aviator Major Chris “Wedge” Mitchell is flying an F35E Lightning over the Strait of Hormuz, testing a new stealth technology as he flirts with Iranian airspace. By the end of that day, Wedge will be an Iranian prisoner, and Sarah Hunt’s destroyer will lie at the bottom of the sea, sunk by the Chinese Navy. Iran and China have clearly coordinated their moves, which involve the use of powerful new forms of cyber weaponry that render US ships and planes defenseless. In a single day, America’s faith in its military’s strategic pre-eminence is in tatters. A new, terrifying era is at hand. So begins a disturbingly plausible work of speculative fiction, co-authored by an award-winning novelist and decorated Marine veteran and the former commander of NATO, a legendary admiral who has spent much of his career strategically outmaneuvering America’s most tenacious adversaries. Written with a powerful blend of geopolitical sophistication and human empathy, 2034 takes us inside the minds of a global cast of characters–Americans, Chinese, Iranians, Russians, Indians –as a series of arrogant miscalculations on all sides leads the world into an intensifying international storm. In the end, China and the United States will have paid a staggering cost, one that forever alters the global balance of power. Everything in 2034 is an imaginative extrapolation from present-day facts on the ground combined with the authors’ years working at the highest and most classified levels of national security. Sometimes it takes a brilliant work of fiction to illuminate the most dire of warnings: 2034 is all too close at hand, and this cautionary tale presents the reader a dark yet possible future that we must do all we can to avoid."

In adult life I try and read a few lines every day - in Arabic and English. During the month of Ramadhan, Muslims try and read the whole Quran (in Arabic). I have never quite managed to do, given the constraints of work and commuting, as well as the difficulty of reading the Arabic for a non-Arabic speaker. This year, working from home due to being in lockdown and not having to commute to work, I was able to get pretty close - I got through about 27 of the 30 parts of the Quran. (I finished the rest off in the weeks that followed.) Every day, I would read the Arabic for one “part” and then the English translation. Reading the whole Quran this way from front to back (rather than dipping in and out) gives you a better sense of the broader themes in the Quran. You read various portions of the story of Biblical prophets such Adam, Noah, Abraham, Joseph, Moses, David and Solomon interweaved with each other. There are non-Biblical stories giving the example of the peoples of Ad and Thamud and the prophet Saleh. The story of Mary and Jesus is also mentioned in numerous places in the Quran. Other than a chapter dedicated to the story of Joseph, the Quran never gives a complete narrative in one place - instead it uses the examples of different prophets in different places to make a point. Obviously I have some degree of bias, being a Muslim, but I do recommend non-Muslims to read the Quran with a good translation (such as this one). Although it shares many of the characters that are in the Bible, the overall feel and flow of the Quran is very different.

Lencioni\n\n\nisbn-13: 9781119600459\nHardcover\nPublisher’s Description:\n“Shay was still angry but shrugged nonchalantly as if to say, it’s not that big of a deal. “So, what am I wrong about?” “You’re not going to want to hear this, but I have to tell you anyway.” Liam paused before finishing. “You might be working hard, but you’re not doing it for the company.” “What the hell does that mean?” Shay wanted to know. Knowing that his adversary might punch him for what he was about to say, Liam responded. “You’re doing it for yourself.” New York Times best-selling author Patrick Lencioni has written a dozen books that focus on how leaders can build teams and lead organizations. In The Motive, he shifts his attention toward helping them understand the importance of why they’re leading in the first place. In what may be his edgiest page-turner to date, Lencioni thrusts his readers into a day-long conversation between rival CEOs. Shay Davis is the CEO of Golden Gate Alarm, who, after just a year in his role, is beginning to worry about his job and is desperate to figure out how to turn things around. With nowhere else to turn, Shay receives some hard-to-swallow advice from the most unlikely and unwanted source—Liam Alcott, CEO of a more successful security company and his most hated opponent. Lencioni uses unexpected plot twists and crisp dialogue to take us on a journey that culminates in a resolution that is as unexpected as it is enlightening. As he does in his other books, he then provides a straightforward summary of the lessons from the fable, combining a clear explanation of his theory with practical advice to help executives examine their true motivation for leading. In addition to provoking readers to honestly assess themselves, Lencioni presents action steps for changing their approach in five key areas. In doing so, he helps leaders avoid the pitfalls that stifle their organizations and even hurt the people they are meant to serve.”"

    "text": "Introduction\n“Making Sense of Chaos: A Better Economics for a Better World” is both a scientific manifesto and a memoir by J. Doyne Farmer, a pioneer in the fields of chaos theory and complex systems. The book presents a compelling argument for a paradigm shift in how we understand and manage the global economy. Farmer argues that standard economic theory—specifically neoclassical economics—has failed to predict major events or solve systemic problems because it relies on outdated assumptions like “equilibrium” and “perfect rationality” [1].\nInstead, Farmer proposes a new framework known as Complexity Economics. He suggests viewing the economy not as a static machine seeking balance, but as a Complex Adaptive System, similar to a biological ecosystem or the weather. By leveraging big data and high-power computing, Farmer posits that we can simulate the economy to make more accurate predictions and address existential challenges like financial instability and climate change [2]."

    "section": "Overview of the Key Points",
    "text": "Overview of the Key Points\nFarmer details specific tools and models that differentiate Complexity Economics from the status quo.\n\nAgent-Based Models (ABMs)\nThe core technological proposal of the book is the use of Agent-Based Models. Unlike standard models that often rely on a “representative agent” to stand in for all consumers, ABMs simulate millions of individual diverse agents—people, banks, and firms—interacting according to simple rules. These simulations allow complex, emergent behaviors, such as market crashes or booms, to arise naturally from bottom-up interactions, providing a more realistic picture of the economy [3].\n\n\nThe Ecology of Strategies\nDrawing from his experience in financial trading, Farmer describes financial markets as an evolutionary “ecology” rather than an efficient system. In this view, different trading strategies compete, mutate, and die out, similar to species in nature. This evolutionary perspective helps explain why markets are inherently unstable and prone to bubbles, challenging the traditional “Efficient Market Hypothesis” [4].\n\n\nThe Weather Forecasting Analogy\nA recurring analogy in the book is the comparison between economics and meteorology. Farmer notes that fifty years ago, weather forecasts were largely unreliable. However, through the application of physics-based models and massive data ingestion, meteorology has become a highly accurate science. He argues that economics must undergo a similar “scientific revolution,” abandoning abstract philosophy in favor of data-driven simulation [1]."

    "section": "Overview of the Key Themes",
    "text": "Overview of the Key Themes\nThe book addresses several broad themes that extend beyond technical economics into policy and society.\n\nThe Failure of Standard Economics\nFarmer critiques the current standard, particularly Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) models used by central banks. He argues these models failed to predict the 2008 financial crisis because they treat the financial sector as a neutral “veil” and assume the system always tends toward balance. He suggests that adhering to these flawed models blinds policymakers to systemic risks [2].\n\n\nClimate Change and the Green Transition\nA significant portion of the book applies complexity economics to the climate crisis. Farmer highlights Wright’s Law, which describes how costs drop predictably as production volume increases (learning curves). His models suggest that the transition to renewable energy will be significantly cheaper and faster than standard economists predict. He argues that an aggressive green transition could save the global economy trillions, rather than being a costly burden [3].\n\n\nInequality and Networks\nFarmer explores how the structure of economic networks naturally leads to wealth concentration. While standard models often ignore the specific web of who owes money to whom, Farmer’s network approach reveals how debt linkages can amplify inequality and systemic risk. He illustrates how network effects can trap wealth in specific clusters, exacerbating social divides [4]."

By simulating policy decisions—such as lockdowns or carbon taxes—before they are implemented, society can avoid disastrous unintended consequences. Ultimately, Farmer is optimistic: he believes that if economics transforms into a true science based on data and simulation, it can guide humanity through the crises of the 21st century [1]."

David Marquet\n\n\nisbn-13: 9780735217539\nAudible\nPublisher’s Description\nWall Street Journal Bestseller From the acclaimed author of Turn the Ship Around!, former US Navy Captain David Marquet, comes a radical new playbook for empowering your team to make better decisions and take greater ownership. You might imagine that an effective leader is someone who makes quick, intelligent decisions, gives inspiring speeches, and issues clear orders to their team so they can execute a plan to achieve your organization’s goals. Unfortunately, David Marquet argues, that’s an outdated model of leadership that just doesn’t work anymore. As a leader in today’s networked, information-dense business climate, you don’t have full visibility into your organization or the ground reality of your operating environment. In order to harness the eyes, ears, and minds of your people, you need to foster a climate of collaborative experimentation that encourages people to speak up when they notice problems and work together to identify and test solutions. Too many leaders fall in love with the sound of their own voice, and wind up dictating plans and digging in their heels when problems begin to emerge. Even when you want to be a more collaborative leader, you can undermine your own efforts by defaulting to command-and-control language we’ve inherited from the industrial era. It’s time to ditch the industrial age playbook of leadership. In Leadership is Language, you’ll learn how choosing your words can dramatically improve decision-making and execution on your team. Marquet outlines six plays for all leaders, anchored in how you use language: • Control the clock, don’t obey the clock: Pre-plan decision points and give your people the tools they need to hit pause on a plan of action if they notice something wrong. • Collaborate, don’t coerce: As the leader, you should be the last one to offer your opinion. Rather than locking your team into binary responses (“Is this a good plan?”), allow them to answer on a scale (“How confident are you about this plan?”) • Commit, don’t comply: Rather than expect your team to comply with specific directions, explain your overall goals, and get their commitment to achieving it one piece at a time. • Complete, not continue: If every day feels like a repetition of the last, you’re doing something wrong. Articulate concrete plans with a start and end date to align your team. • Improve, don’t prove: Ask your people to improve on plans and processes, rather than prove that they can meet fixed goals or deadlines. You’ll face fewer cut corners and better long-term results. • Connect, don’t conform: Flatten hierarchies in your organization and connect with your people to encourage them to contribute to decision- making. In his last book, Turn the Ship Around!, Marquet told the incredible story of abandoning command-and-control leadership on his submarine and empowering his crew to turn the worst performing submarine to the best performer in the fleet. Now, with Leadership is Language he gives businesspeople the tools they need to achieve such transformational leadership in their organizations."

    "text": "Boyd - The Fighter Pilot Who Changed The Art Of War by Robert Coram\n\n\nisbn-13: 9780316796880\nAudible\nJohn Boyd is probably up there in list of most influential Americans of the 20th Century that very few people have heard of. A great fighter pilot who then went on to design the F-15 and F-16 fighter aircraft and ended his career as a military theorist whose ideas the US successfully used in both Gulf Wars. Boyd was an iconoclast who continually found himself fighting the Air Force hierarchy. As well as in-depth biography of Boyd, the book also provides an eye-opening inside view of Military-Industrial complex that Eisenhower warned of. Boyd was deeply flawed in many ways but had a personal code of honor that guided him throughout his career. My favorite quote of Boyd’s from the book is:\n\n“If your boss demands loyalty, give him integrity. But if he demands integrity, then give him loyalty”\n\nThere are a small number of Audible books that I like so much that I buy a physical copy of the book. This is one of those books.\nAnother great quote:\n\n“To be somebody or to do something. In life there is often a roll call. That’s when you will have to make a decision. To be or to do? Which way will you go?”\n\nPublisher’s Description: “John Boyd may be the most remarkable unsung hero in all of American military history. Some remember him as the greatest U.S. fighter pilot ever – the man who, in simulated air-to-air combat, defeated every challenger in less than forty seconds. Some recall him as the father of our country’s most legendary fighter aircraft – the F-15 and F-16. Still others think of Boyd as the most influential military theorist since Sun Tzu. They know only half the story. Boyd, more than any other person, saved fighter aviation from the predations of the Strategic Air Command. His manual of fighter tactics changed the way every air force in the world flies and fights. He discovered a physical theory that forever altered the way fighter planes were designed. Later in life, he developed a theory of military strategy that has been adopted throughout the world and even applied to business models for maximizing efficiency. And in one of the most startling and unknown stories of modern military history, the Air Force fighter pilot taught the U.S. Marine Corps how to fight war on the ground. His ideas led to America’s swift and decisive victory in the Gulf War and foretold the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. On a personal level, Boyd rarely met a general he couldn’t offend. He was loud, abrasive, and profane. A man of daring, ferocious passion and intractable stubbornness, he was that most American of heroes – a rebel who cared not for his reputation or fortune but for his country. He was a true patriot, a man who made a career of challenging the shortsighted and self-serving Pentagon bureaucracy. America owes Boyd and his disciples – the six men known as the”Acolytes” – a great debt. Robert Coram finally brings to light the remarkable story of a man who polarized all who knew him, but who left a legacy that will influence the military – and all of America – for decades to come. ..”"

It doesn’t just discuss viral contagion, but also financial crises, viral online contents and the spread of ideas. The author is a mathematician and professor of epedemiology.\nOverall, an interesting but not essential read. Perhaps would have been a better book to actually read rather than listen to on Audible.\nSome takeaways:\n\nEvery outbreak is unique. While some outbreaks spread quickly, others ebb off just as fast.\nMathematical models help show the growth of epidemics.\nContagions can affect many industries, including the financial industry.\nContagions can also spread through your social circle.\nGun violence may be a type of behavior that’s socially contagious.\nSocial behavior online may be different from real life. Abusive “trolling” behavior is common.\nUsing big data can help with outbreak research but it’s not a panacea.\n\nPublisher’s Description: “From ad servers to Zika, Ebola to fake news, why the science of infection is the science of modern life In our social-media-laden lives, everyone thinks they understand how things, whether YouTube fads or bank failures, spread: they go viral. In The Rules of Contagion, Adam Kucharski unpacks the science of epidemiology – the movement of diseases – to reveal what is, and isn’t, viral in modern life. Is it true that fake news spreads because it’s an unstoppable mind virus? Actually, brute-force attacks on our attention, not manipulation, explain most of it. Exploring everything from the onset of riots to the power of Instagram influencers, Kucharski shows how hackneyed the popular understanding of virality can be, and how much more compelling the real story is. Whether you are an author seeking an audience, a defender of the truth, or simply someone interested in the science of human social behavior, The Rules of Contagion is essential guide to modern life.”"

    "text": "War and Peace by Leo Tolstoy\n\n\nisbn-13: 9780192833983\nAudible\n\nAI Generated Content\n\n\nGenerated by gemini-3-pro-preview\n\n\n\nImage generated by gemini-3-pro-image-preview in the style of XKCD - with apologies to Randall Munroe\n\n\nLeo Tolstoy’s War and Peace is a sprawling epic that chronicles the French invasion of Russia and the impact of the Napoleonic era on Tsarist society through the stories of five Russian aristocratic families: the Bezukhovs, the Bolkonskys, the Rostovs, the Kuragins, and the Drubetskoys. First published in its entirety in 1869, the work defies standard classification, blending historical fiction with philosophical essays. The narrative arc spans from 1805 to 1820, moving between the salons of St. Petersburg and the brutal battlefields of Austerlitz and Borodino.\nThe plot begins in July 1805 at a soirée hosted by Anna Pavlovna Scherer. Here, the reader is introduced to the illegitimate Pierre Bezukhov, a socially awkward intellectual who champions Napoleonic ideals, and Prince Andrei Bolkonsky, an intelligent but disillusioned man seeking escape from his stifling marriage and societal superficiality by joining the army as an aide-de-camp to General Kutuzov. As the narrative unfolds, Pierre inherits his father’s vast fortune and the title of Count, making him the most eligible bachelor in Russia. He falls into a disastrous marriage with the beautiful but manipulative Hélène Kuragina. Meanwhile, Andrei participates in the Battle of Austerlitz. After being wounded, he undergoes a profound spiritual realization while gazing at the sky, realizing the insignificance of his former hero, Napoleon, compared to the infinite heavens.\nDuring the intervening years of peace, the lives of the protagonists intersect with the Rostov family. Natasha Rostova, the embodiment of vitality and spontaneity, becomes the novel’s emotional center. Andrei, a widower following the death of his wife in childbirth, falls in love with Natasha, seeing in her a chance for renewal. However, a year-long engagement imposed by Andrei’s father leads to a crisis; Natasha is seduced by Hélène’s dissolute brother, Anatole Kuragin, and attempts to elope. The engagement is broken, leaving Natasha disgraced and Andrei bitter. Pierre, who has been searching for meaning through Freemasonry and philanthropy, acts as a comforting friend to Natasha, suppressing his own love for her.\nThe narrative reaches its climax with Napoleon’s invasion of Russia in 1812. The Battle of Borodino serves as a focal point where the varying threads of the story collide. Pierre, seeking to understand the war, wanders the battlefield in civilian clothes, witnessing the chaotic reality of combat which contrasts sharply with military strategy. Prince Andrei is mortally wounded by an exploding shell. Following the battle, the Russians abandon Moscow. The Rostovs flee the city, taking wounded soldiers with them, unknowingly including Prince Andrei. In a moment of redemption, Natasha nurses the dying Andrei, and they reconcile before he succumbs to his wounds.\nPierre remains in Moscow, intent on assassinating Napoleon, but is captured by the French. During his imprisonment and the subsequent harrowing retreat of the French army, Pierre undergoes a final transformation. He meets Platon Karataev, a simple peasant soldier who embodies a philosophy of acceptance and living in the moment. This interaction helps Pierre strip away his intellectual anxieties and find spiritual peace.\nThe novel concludes with two epilogues. The first, set in 1820, depicts the domestic lives of the survivors. Pierre has married Natasha, and they live a happy, chaotic family life. Nikolai Rostov has married Andrei’s pious sister, Princess Marya Bolkonskaya, rebuilding the family fortunes. The second epilogue moves away from the narrative entirely to present Tolstoy’s historiographical thesis. He argues against the “Great Man” theory of history, positing that historical events are not caused by the will of leaders like Napoleon or Alexander I, but by the sum of infinitely small individual wills and an inevitable, deterministic chain of cause and effect.\nThe character development in War and Peace is extensive, focusing primarily on the spiritual journeys of Pierre and Andrei. Pierre evolves from a dissipated, naive youth into a man of moral substance. His journey is one of trial and error; he tries dissipation, Freemasonry, and heroism, but ultimately finds wisdom in the simplicity of Karataev and the domestic love of Natasha. Tolstoy writes of Pierre’s realization: “Man can be master of nothing while he fears death, but he who does not fear it possesses all.”\nPrince Andrei represents the intellectual and cynical path. He seeks glory, then administrative utility, and finally domestic happiness, but finds them all lacking. His development is defined by his encounters with death—first at Austerlitz and finally at Borodino—which lead him to a detached, universal love that is incompatible with earthly life. Natasha Rostova transforms from a child of impulse and joy into a woman humbled by suffering, eventually finding fulfillment in the role of a matriarch, having discarded the social graces of her youth.\nTolstoy also juxtaposes historical figures to serve his thematic ends. Napoleon is depicted as arrogant and deluded, believing he controls history while actually being a puppet of it. In contrast, the Russian commander Kutuzov is portrayed as wise and passive; he understands that he cannot direct the “swarm-life” of the army but can only align himself with the inevitable flow of events.\nA central theme of the work is the search for the meaning of life, contrasted against the artificiality of high society. Tolstoy validates the “real” life of nature, peasantry, and honest emotion over the “artificial” life of court politics and military theorizing. This is evident in the dichotomy between the authentic Rostovs and the artificial Kuragins.\nThe philosophy of history is the novel’s other major theme. Tolstoy relentlessly attacks the idea that military genius determines outcomes. He suggests that battles are won by the spirit of the common soldier rather than the tactics of generals. As Prince Andrei notes before Borodino: “Success never depends, and never will depend, on position, on equipment, or even on numbers, and least of all on position… Success depends on the feeling that is in me and in him, in each soldier, and in the battalion.”\nWar and Peace ultimately presents a holistic view of human existence, suggesting that while individuals have no control over the grand sweep of history, they possess the free will to choose moral action and find happiness in the immediate reality of their daily lives.\n\n\nQuotes\n\nInfluence in society, however, is capital which has to be economized if it is to last. Prince Vasili knew this, and having once realized that if he asked on behalf of all who begged of him, he would soon be unable to ask for himself, he became chary of using his influence.\n\n\n’Never, never marry, my dear fellow! That’s my advice: never marry till you can say to yourself that you have done all you are capable of, and until you have ceased to love the woman of your choice and have seen her plainly as she is, or else you will make a cruel and irrevocable mistake. Marry when you are old and good for nothing—or all that is good and noble in you will be lost. It will all be wasted on trifles.\n\n\nPierre was always astonished at Prince Andrei’s calm manner of treating everybody, his extraordinary memory, his extensive reading (he had read everything, knew everything, and had an opinion about everything), but above all at his capacity for work and study.\n\n\nEven in the best, most friendly and simplest relations of life, praise and commendation are essential, just as grease is necessary to wheels that they may run smoothly."

    "text": "Introduction\n“Sizing People Up: A Veteran FBI Agent’s User Manual for Behavior Prediction” is a comprehensive guide to assessing trustworthiness and predicting human behavior, authored by Robin Dreeke with Cameron Stauth. Dreeke, the former head of the FBI’s Behavioral Analysis Program, leverages over two decades of experience in counterintelligence to present a systematic approach to interpersonal evaluation. The book argues that trust should not be reliant on intuition or “gut feelings,” which can be easily manipulated by charisma, but rather on a methodical analysis of observable behaviors and vested interests [1]. The central premise posits that individuals almost always act in their own best interests; therefore, accurately predicting behavior requires understanding what a person perceives as beneficial to themselves [2]."

    "section": "Overview of the key points",
    "text": "Overview of the key points\nThe core framework of the book revolves around six specific signs—often referred to as the “6 Signs of Trustworthiness”—that serve as indicators for evaluating whether someone will act in alignment with your interests. These signs provide a structured method for decoding motivations and predicting future actions [1, 2].\nThe first sign is Vesting, which asks whether the person has a shared stake in the outcome. When your success contributes directly to their own, they are significantly more likely to be trustworthy. The second sign, Longevity, examines whether the person views the relationship as a long-term commitment. Individuals who envision a future connection are less prone to betrayal for short-term gains. Reliability is the third sign, combining competence with diligence; it assesses not just if a person can perform a task, but if they will actually follow through.\nThe fourth sign focuses on Actions. Dreeke emphasizes that past patterns of behavior are the strongest predictors of future actions, often weighing more heavily than words. Language is the fifth sign, analyzing communication styles. Trustworthy individuals tend to use “we” language rather than “I,” and they validate others’ thoughts rather than dismissing them. Finally, Stability looks at how a person handles stress and uncertainty. Emotional stability is crucial for ensuring that a person remains predictable and rational, even when under pressure [2]."

    "section": "Overview of the key themes",
    "text": "Overview of the key themes\nA primary theme of the book is the shift from Rationality vs. Intuition. Dreeke strongly advocates for replacing emotional instincts with a rational, checklist-based approach. He suggests that relying on “gut feelings” is often a liability, as these can be biased by a person’s likeability or manipulative tactics [3]. Instead, readers are encouraged to collect data and analyze it objectively.\nAnother significant theme is Trust as a System. Rather than viewing trust as an abstract moral virtue, the book presents it as a calculable outcome of aligned interests and consistent behavior. This perspective removes the guesswork from relationships, treating trust as a risk assessment exercise. Validation also plays a critical role; while it is a tool for building rapport, it is also a metric for assessment. The book notes that while trustworthy people validate others, manipulators often seek validation primarily for themselves [2]. Additionally, the theme of Contextual Behavior highlights that trustworthiness is dynamic—someone may be reliable in one specific context where they are vested, but not in another."

By mastering the six signs of behavior prediction, individuals can navigate their professional and personal relationships with confidence rather than suspicion. The goal of “sizing people up” is not to become cynical, but to build stronger, more authentic alliances by ensuring that those you trust are both capable of and motivated to support you [1, 3]."

Now out in paperback, Matterhorn is an epic war novel in the tradition of Norman Mailer’s The Naked and the Dead and James Jones’s The Thin Red Line. It is the timeless story of a young Marine lieutenant, Waino Mellas, and his comrades in Bravo Company, who are dropped into the mountain jungle of Vietnam as boys and forced to fight their way into manhood. Standing in their way are not merely the North Vietnamese but also monsoon rain and mud, leeches and tigers, disease and malnutrition. Almost as daunting, it turns out, are the obstacles they discover between each other: racial tension, competing ambitions, and duplicitous superior officers. But when the company finds itself surrounded and outnumbered by a massive enemy regiment, the Marines are thrust into the raw and all- consuming terror of combat. The experience will change them forever. Matterhorn is a visceral and spellbinding novel about what it is like to be a young man at war. It is an unforgettable novel that transforms the tragedy of Vietnam into a powerful and universal story of courage, camaraderie, and sacrifice: a parable not only of the war in Vietnam but of all war, and a testament to the redemptive power of literature."

Chris is a former colleague from our Bank of America days on the Quartz team, and I can attest to Chris being a great communicator.\nAs Chris explains in his book, only a relatively small fraction of a developer’s impact (say 30% as a rule of thumb) is down to their technical capabilities - a much larger fraction is down to how well they communicate with others. I say “introductory” because the book covers a lot of ground and aims for breadth rather than depth. In many ways the book is a field guide to all the non-technical aspects of what software developer does. Although it introduces a host of theories and mental models, this is a very practical book with a host of actionable tips in each chapter of what to do or not to do.\nDespite being most useful for early career developers, even more seasoned professionals can gain valuable tips and insights from the book. This is a self-published book, so don’t expect the polish of say an O’Reilly book and the numerous links that Chris provides work better on the kindle version than the hardcopy version."

You may not like Facebook, but you can’t deny its success. And to a large degree, that success stems from the”move fast” ethos. The entire culture of Facebook is built for speed. Move Fast is an exploration of modern software strategies and tactics through the lens of Facebook. Relying on in-depth interviews with more than two dozen Facebook engineers, this book explores the product strategy, cultural principles, and technologies that made Facebook the dominant social networking company. Most importantly, Move Fast investigates how you can apply those strategies to your creative projects. It’s not easy to build a software company, but once you know how to move fast, your company will be prepared to build a strategy that benefits from the world’s rapid changes, rather than suffering from them.”"

Join a young CIA officer as he recruits a reluctant foreign agent. And sit with an accomplished surgeon as he tries, and fails, to convince yet another cancer patient to opt for the less risky course of treatment. In Supercommunicators, Charles Duhigg blends deep research and his trademark storytelling skills to show how we can all learn to identify and leverage the hidden layers that lurk beneath every conversation. Communication is a superpower and the best communicators understand that whenever we speak, we’re actually participating in one of three conversations: practical (What’s this really about?), emotional (How do we feel?), and social (Who are we?). If you don’t know what kind of conversation you’re having, you’re unlikely to connect. Supercommunicators know the importance of recognizing—and then matching—each kind of conversation, and how to hear the complex emotions, subtle negotiations, and deeply held beliefs that color so much of what we say and how we listen. Our experiences, our values, our emotional lives—and how we see ourselves, and others—shape every discussion, from who will pick up the kids to how we want to be treated at work. In this book, you will learn why some people are able to make themselves heard, and to hear others, so clearly. With his storytelling that takes us from the writers’ room of The Big Bang Theory to the couches of leading marriage counselors, Duhigg shows readers how to recognize these three conversations—and teaches us the tips and skills we need to navigate them more successfully. In the end, he delivers a simple but powerful lesson: With the right tools, we can connect with anyone."

The key concept is that we tend to judge a decision by the result that it produced - a positive result means it was a good decision, a negative result means it was a bad decision. In reality, you can get lucky and get a good result from a bad decision or unlucky and get a bad result from a good decision. We need to assess the quality of the decision using the a-priori information available at the time rather than the after-the-fact result. The author then elaborates on this using her experience as a professional-poker player to help us see decisions as bets on the future with our degree of confidence in the decision analagous to the betting-odds. Overall, an interesting read, but you could probably get 80% of the value by just reading a detailed review."

At this point though perhaps I’m too familiar with the pattern of Connelly’s writing - as soon as the character that turned out to be the villain was introduced, it was easy to guess that he was not just a sideshow but would reappear later in the novel."

    "text": "Plot Summary and Story Arc\nThe narrative centers on Simon Sharman, a former MI6 officer whose career ended in disgrace following a botched operation in Vienna involving arms dealers. Now working in the private sector on low-level surveillance and due diligence tasks, Sharman is financially insecure and professionally isolated. His stasis is interrupted when he is contacted by a retired Oxford don and former intelligence recruiter who claims to possess explosive information regarding a long-dormant Soviet network.\nWhen the contact dies under suspicious circumstances—ruled a suicide by authorities but doubted by Sharman—the protagonist inherits the investigation. The central mystery revolves around the theory that Soviet intelligence recruited a cell at Oxford parallel to the Cambridge spy ring. Unlike their Cambridge counterparts, who were driven by communist ideology, the Oxford ring is depicted as being motivated by a nihilistic desire for power and self-preservation, allowing them to transition seamlessly from serving the USSR to serving the modern Russian Federation.\nSharman’s investigation leads him into a labyrinth of Russian oligarch money, compromised politicians, and a private intelligence firm that operates in the grey zones of the law. As he peels back the layers of the conspiracy, he discovers that the network is not a historical relic but an active threat facilitating Russian influence operations within the highest echelons of the British government. The arc follows Sharman as he moves from a cynical outsider to a man burdened with the responsibility of exposing a rot that the official services are too compromised or too bureaucratic to see. The climax involves a race to secure proof of the ring’s existence before the network utilizes its institutional power to silence Sharman permanently."

    "text": "Character Development\nSimon Sharman Sharman is characterized as the archetypal “outsider” spy. Having been ejected from the “Company,” he operates without the safety net of diplomatic immunity or institutional backup. This status defines his methodology; he relies on old-school tradecraft, physical surveillance, and intuition rather than high-tech gadgetry. His development is defined by a shift from apathy to moral agency. Initially motivated by the need for a paycheck, he becomes driven by a patriotic duty to protect a state that rejected him. His cynicism is a defense mechanism, masking a lingering adherence to the ethical standards of his former profession.\nThe Establishment While there are specific antagonists, the true antagonist of the novel is the British Establishment itself. Beaumont populates the book with characters who represent the intersection of old money, elite education, and political power. These characters are depicted not merely as traitors but as individuals who believe they are above the nation-state. The villains are characterized by their ability to manipulate the class system to evade scrutiny, contrasting sharply with Sharman’s working-class grit."

    "section": "Themes and Messages",
    "text": "Themes and Messages\n\nThe “Fatal Flaw” of British Intelligence\nA primary theme is the blindness of the British class system. The novel posits that the intelligence services were so focused on the Cambridge spies that they ignored Oxford because the potential traitors there looked and sounded exactly like the men hunting them. The book suggests that the establishment protects its own, creating a blind spot that foreign powers can exploit. As the narrative suggests, the Oxford spies were never caught because they were the ones running the country.\n\n\nIdeology vs. Opportunity\nBeaumont draws a distinct line between the Cold War spying of the past and modern espionage. The Cambridge Five are referenced as ideological traitors who believed in a cause. In contrast, the Oxford ring and their modern successors are depicted as being driven by cynicism and greed. This reflects a thematic shift from the binary of Communism vs. Capitalism to a murkier conflict involving kleptocracy and destabilization.\n\n\nThe Persistence of the Past\nThe story underscores the idea that the Cold War never truly ended; it merely changed shape. The narrative argues that the networks established during the Soviet era did not dissolve in 1991 but were repurposed. The book frequently references the “Long Game” played by Russian intelligence, contrasting it with the short-term political cycles of Western democracies."

The focus is on the minutiae of espionage—dead drops, counter-surveillance routes, and asset validation—rather than cinematic action sequences. The tone is somber and analytical, prioritizing the intellectual puzzle of counter-intelligence over high-octane thrills.\nThrough Sharman, Beaumont offers a critique of modern Britain, portraying a capital city awash in foreign money and a political class that has lost its moral compass. The novel concludes with the immediate threat resolved, but the overarching structural issues within the establishment remaining, setting the stage for future installments."

Jack McEvoy, the journalist who never backs down, tracks a serial killer who has been operating completely under the radar–until now. Veteran reporter Jack McEvoy has taken down killers before, but when a woman he had a one-night stand with is murdered in a particularly brutal way, McEvoy realizes he might be facing a criminal mind unlike any he’s ever encountered. McEvoy investigates—against the warnings of the police and his own editor—and makes a shocking discovery that connects the crime to other mysterious deaths across the country. But his inquiry hits a snag when he himself becomes a suspect. As he races to clear his name, McEvoy’s findings point to a serial killer working under the radar of law enforcement for years, and using personal data shared by the victims themselves to select and hunt his targets. Called”the Raymond Chandler of this generation” (Associated Press), Michael Connelly once again delivers an unputdownable thriller that reveals a predator operating from the darkest corners of human nature—and one man courageous and determined enough to stand in his way.”"

J. Fikry two friends—often in love, but never lovers—come together as creative partners in the world of video game design, where success brings them fame, joy, tragedy, duplicity, and, ultimately, a kind of immortality. “Utterly brilliant. In this sweeping, gorgeously written novel, Gabrielle Zevin charts the beauty, tenacity, and fragility of human love and creativity…. One of the best books I’ve ever read.” —John Green On a bitter-cold day, in the December of his junior year at Harvard, Sam Masur exits a subway car and sees, amid the hordes of people waiting on the platform, Sadie Green. He calls her name. For a moment, she pretends she hasn’t heard him, but then, she turns, and a game begins: a legendary collaboration that will launch them to stardom. These friends, intimates since childhood, borrow money, beg favors, and, before even graduating college, they have created their first blockbuster, Ichigo. Overnight, the world is theirs. Not even twenty-five years old, Sam and Sadie are brilliant, successful, and rich, but these qualities won’t protect them from their own creative ambitions or the betrayals of their hearts. Spanning thirty years, from Cambridge, Massachusetts, to Venice Beach, California, and lands in between and far beyond, Gabrielle Zevin’s Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow is a dazzling and intricately imagined novel that examines the multifarious nature of identity, disability, failure, the redemptive possibilities in play, and above all, our need to connect: to be loved and to love. Yes, it is a love story, but it is not one you have read before."

Blessed with a singular voice and a fiery temperament, Sinéad O’Connor rose to massive fame in the late 1980s and 1990s with a string of gold records. By the time she was twenty, she was world famous–living a rock star life out loud. From her trademark shaved head to her 1992 appearance on Saturday Night Live when she tore up Pope John Paul II’s photograph, Sinéad has fascinated and outraged millions. In Rememberings, O’Connor recounts her painful tale of growing up in Dublin in a dysfunctional, abusive household. Inspired by a brother’s Bob Dylan records, she escaped into music. She relates her early forays with local Irish bands; we see Sinéad completing her first album while eight months pregnant, hanging with Rastas in the East Village, and soaring to unimaginable popularity with her cover of Prince’s “Nothing Compares 2U.” Intimate, replete with candid anecdotes and told in a singular form true to her unconventional career, Sinéad’s memoir is a remarkable chronicle of an enduring and influential artist."

Yet few of us recognize opportunities to think in the first place.\nYou might believe you’re thinking clearly in the moments that matter most. But in all likelihood, when the pressure is on, you won’t be thinking at all. And your subsequent actions will inevitably move you further from the results you ultimately seek—love, belonging, success, wealth, victory. According to Farnam Street founder Shane Parrish, we must get better at recognizing these opportunities for what they are, and deploying our cognitive ability in order to achieve the life we want.\nClear Thinking gives you the tools to recognize the moments that have the potential to transform your trajectory, and reshape how you navigate the critical space between stimulus and response. As Parrish shows, we may imagine we are the protagonists in the story of our lives. But the sad truth is, most of us run on autopilot. Our behavioral defaults, groomed by biology, evolution, and culture, are primed to run the show for us if we don’t intervene. At our worst, we react to events without reasoning, not even realizing that we’ve missed an opportunity to think at all. At our best, we recognize these moments for what they are, and apply the full capacity of our reasoning and rationality to them.\nThrough stories, mental models, and more, Parrish offers the missing link between behavioral science and real-life outcomes. The result is a must-have manual for optimizing decision-making, gaining competitive advantage, and living a more intentional life."

In this gripping account, David Quammen takes the reader along on this astonishing quest to learn how, where from, and why these diseases emerge and asks the terrifying question: What might the next big one be?”\nQuotes\n\nAny such spillover in the reverse direction—from humans to a nonhuman species—is known as an anthroponosis. The famous mountain gorillas, for instance, have been threatened by anthroponotic infections such as measles, carried by ecotourists who come to dote upon them.\n\n\nWith influenza and many other diseases the order is reversed, high infectivity preceding symptoms by a matter of days. A perverse pattern: the danger, then the warning. That probably helped account for the scale of worldwide misery and death during the 1918–1919 influenza: high infectivity among cases before they experienced the most obvious and debilitating stages of illness. The bug traveled ahead of the sense of alarm. And that infamous global pandemic, remember, occurred in the era before globalization. Everything nowadays moves around the planet faster, including viruses.\n\n\nThe much darker story remains to be told, probably not about this virus but about another. When the Next Big One comes, we can guess, it will likely conform to the same perverse pattern, high infectivity preceding notable symptoms. That will help it to move through cities and airports like an angel of death.\n\n\nThat’s the salubrious thing about zoonotic diseases: They remind us, as St. Francis did, that we humans are inseparable from the natural world. In fact, there is no “natural world,” it’s a bad and artificial phrase. There is only the world. Humankind is part of that world, as are the ebolaviruses, as are the influenzas and the HIVs, as are Nipah and Hendra and SARS, as are chimpanzees and bats and palm civets and bar-headed geese, as is the next murderous virus—the one we haven’t yet detected.\n\n\nindividual effort, individual discernment, individual choice can have huge effects in averting the catastrophes that might otherwise sweep through a herd."

Who would you rather decides your future - an algorithm or a human? Before making your decision, bear in mind that the algorithm will always be more consistent, and far less prone to an error of judgement. Then again, at least the human will be able to look you in the eye before determining your fate. How much fairness would you be willing to sacrifice for that human touch? This is just one of the dilemmas we face in the age of the algorithm, where the machine rules supreme, telling us what to watch, where to go, even who to send to prison. As increasingly we rely on them to automate big, important decisions - in crime, healthcare, transport, money - they raise questions that cut to the heart of what we want our society to look like, forcing us to decide what matters most. Is helping doctors to diagnose patients more or less important than preserving our anonymity? Should we prevent people from becoming victims of crime, or protect innocent people from being falsely accused? Hannah Fry takes us on a tour through the good, the bad, and the downright ugly of the algorithms that surround us. In Hello World she lifts the lid on their inner workings, demonstrates their power, exposes their limitations, and examines whether they really are an improvement on the human systems they replace."

Widower Mukesh lives a quiet life in Wembley, in West London after losing his beloved wife. He shops every Wednesday, goes to Temple, and worries about his granddaughter, Priya, who hides in her room reading while he spends his evenings watching nature documentaries. Aleisha is a bright but anxious teenager working at the local library for the summer when she discovers a crumpled-up piece of paper in the back of To Kill a Mockingbird. It’s a list of novels that she’s never heard of before. Intrigued, and a little bored with her slow job at the checkout desk, she impulsively decides to read every book on the list, one after the other. As each story gives up its magic, the books transport Aleisha from the painful realities she’s facing at home. When Mukesh arrives at the library, desperate to forge a connection with his bookworm granddaughter, Aleisha passes along the reading list…hoping that it will be a lifeline for him too. Slowly, the shared books create a connection between two lonely souls, as fiction helps them escape their grief and everyday troubles and find joy again."

I will say that that for me, the first section (“Where I’m Coming From”) was the most interesting and engaging part of the book. “Life Principles” provided much food for thought but “Work Principles” started getting a bit heavy going. A summary of the principles is giving below: “Think for yourself to decide 1) what you want, 2) what is true, and 3) what you should do to achieve #1 in light of #2, and do that with humility and open-mindedness so that you consider the best thinking that is available to you.” LIFE PRINCIPLES 1.

But Circe is a strange child–not powerful, like her father, nor viciously alluring like her mother. Turning to the world of mortals for companionship, she discovers that she does possess power–the power of witchcraft, which can transform rivals into monsters and menace the gods themselves. Threatened, Zeus banishes her to a deserted island, where she hones her occult craft, tames wild beasts and crosses paths with many of the most famous figures in all of mythology, including the Minotaur, Daedalus and his doomed son Icarus, the murderous Medea, and, of course, wily Odysseus. But there is danger, too, for a woman who stands alone, and Circe unwittingly draws the wrath of both men and gods, ultimately finding herself pitted against one of the most terrifying and vengeful of the Olympians. To protect what she loves most, Circe must summon all her strength and choose, once and for all, whether she belongs with the gods she is born from, or the mortals she has come to love. With unforgettably vivid characters, mesmerizing language and page-turning suspense, Circe is a triumph of storytelling, an intoxicating epic of family rivalry, palace intrigue, love and loss, as well as a celebration of indomitable female strength in a man’s world.”"

There’s no one better qualified than a talented journalist to introduce you to the right mindset and skillset—and this book does it with science and humor.” -Adam Grant, #1 New York Times bestselling author of Originals and Give and Take “An essential book for our times.” -Lori Gottlieb, New York Times bestselling author of Maybe You Should Talk to Someone At work, we’re taught to lead the conversation. On social media, we shape our personal narratives. At parties, we talk over one another. So do our politicians. We’re not listening. And no one is listening to us. Despite living in a world where technology allows constant digital communication and opportunities to connect, it seems no one is really listening or even knows how. And it’s making us lonelier, more isolated, and less tolerant than ever before. A listener by trade, New York Times contributor Kate Murphy wanted to know how we got here. In this always illuminating and often humorous deep dive, Murphy explains why we’re not listening, what it’s doing to us, and how we can reverse the trend. She makes accessible the psychology, neuroscience, and sociology of listening while also introducing us to some of the best listeners out there (including a CIA agent, focus group moderator, bartender, radio producer, and top furniture salesman). Equal parts cultural observation, scientific exploration, and rousing call to action that’s full of practical advice, You’re Not Listening is to listening what Susan Cain’s Quiet was to introversion. It’s time to stop talking and start listening."

    "section": "Key Points",
    "text": "Key Points\n\nThe Nature of Communication and Redundancy\nThe book opens with an analysis of the “talking drums” used in Africa. Gleick explains that these drums did not function like a telegraph (letter-by-letter) but rather transmitted stereotypical phrases. Because the drums had limited tonal variation, the drummers relied heavily on redundancy and context to eliminate ambiguity and ensure the message was understood despite noise or distance. This establishes a central theme: redundancy is essential for accuracy in communication systems.\n\n“Stereotyped phrases, redundant and formulaic, were the only vehicle for the transmission of culture.” (p. 25, Pantheon First Edition)\n\n\n\nThe Separation of Information from Meaning\nA crucial turning point in the history of information was the realization that “information” could be quantified and processed independently of its semantic meaning. This began with the development of the telegraph and Morse code, which treated letters as abstract symbols to be encoded, transmitted, and decoded.\n\n\nBabbage, Lovelace, and the Analytical Engine\nGleick details the contributions of Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace. While Babbage designed the hardware (the Difference Engine and the Analytical Engine), Lovelace conceptualized the potential of the machine to manipulate symbols, not just numbers. She foresaw that a computer could process any form of information—music, letters, or logic—if it could be converted into data.\n\n\nClaude Shannon and the Bit\nThe core of the book revolves around Claude Shannon, a Bell Labs mathematician who published “A Mathematical Theory of Communication” in 1948. Shannon defined the fundamental unit of information as the “bit” (binary digit). He demonstrated that all information could be reduced to yes/no choices. Shannon’s theory treated information as a measure of uncertainty or “entropy”—the more uncertain the outcome, the more information is contained in the message resolving it.\n\n“The bit is a universal measure for the amount of information… It measures the amount of uncertainty in a message.” (p. 220)\n\n\n\nEntropy and Maxwell’s Demon\nGleick explores the intersection of thermodynamics and information theory. He discusses the thought experiment known as “Maxwell’s Demon,” utilized to distinguish between heat and information. The book explains how physicists eventually reconciled the two fields, concluding that the erasure of information dissipates energy, linking the abstract concept of the bit to physical laws.\n\n\nDNA as Code\nThe narrative shifts to biology, framing the discovery of the structure of DNA as an information revolution. Gleick posits that life itself is an information process. The genetic code is treated as a transmission of data across generations, subject to noise (mutations) and requiring error correction, fitting perfectly into Shannon’s framework.\n\n“The gene has become the archetypal information carrier… The biosphere is a web of information.” (p. 297)\n\n\n\nThe Flood\nThe final section addresses the exponential growth of generated data. Gleick describes the transition from information scarcity (where the primary struggle was preservation and transmission) to information surfeit. He discusses the challenges of filtering, searching (Google), and storing data (Wikipedia and the “Library of Babel”). The “flood” refers to the psychological and societal impact of having access to more information than can be cognitively processed.\n\n“We have to create the strategies for our own survival in the flood… coping with the abundance of information.” (p. 410)"

As for most of these books, dont expect a work of art, but its an effective way to get information across and more enjoyable than reading a dry treatise on a management topic. At the end the book has a section that reviews the model presented in the ‘fable’.\nI like the concept of OKRs and they seem like a simple yet effective way to set goals for a team or organization.\n\nModel\n\nO = Objective\nThis is what you want to accomplish. Should be qualitative and inspirational, make you want to get out of bed in the morning.\n\n\nKR = Key Results\nThese are how you know you’ve achieved your objective. They should be quantitative stretch targets (difficult to achieve, but not impossible). Each KR starts out with a 50% confidence level that it will be achieved. The confidence level is adjusted every week to indicate how close to achieving the KR you are. OKRs are set at the company or team level either annually or quartlerly. For small companies/teams, a single OKR is preferable; 2-3 are probably acceptable for a larger organization; 5 is too many to remember and track.\n\nHealth Metrics\nThese are metrics you want to protect while achieving your OKRs.\n\n\nWeekly Priorities\nThese are the 3 to 5 things you need to do each week to help achieve the OKRs. They are marked as P1 - must do, - and P2 - should do."

The book chronicles the remarkable three-decade partnership between two men from vastly different backgrounds—Van Den Heever, a white South African game ranger, and Mhlongo, a legendary Shangaan tracker [1]. Set against the stunning backdrop of the Londolozi Game Reserve in the Sabi Sands, South Africa, the narrative transcends a simple collection of bush stories to become a profound exploration of cross-cultural friendship, trust, and the healing of historical wounds in post-Apartheid South Africa [3]."

    "text": "Overview of the Key Points\nThe narrative is structured chronologically, tracing the evolution of Alex and Renias’s relationship from a strictly professional hierarchy to a deep, brotherly bond.\nA defining moment in their early partnership involves the tracking of the “Tugwaan female,” a notoriously elusive and aggressive leopard. Alex, then a young and inexperienced guide feeling the pressure to perform for guests, initially doubts Renias’s tracking decisions. When Renias successfully locates the predator based on signs invisible to Alex—and subsequently protects Alex during a tense confrontation—the dynamic shifts. This encounter forces Alex to confront his own ego and recognize Renias not as a subordinate, but as a master of the environment [3].\nThe book expands beyond the African savanna, detailing the duo’s international expeditions. They travel to South America to track jaguars and to the United States to track grizzly bears, demonstrating the universality of their tracking skills [2]. These adventures highlight their professional synergy and the seamless non-verbal communication they developed over years of facing danger together.\nA significant portion of the book focuses on “The Realisation of a Dream”: the founding of the Tracker Academy. Recognizing that indigenous tracking skills were in danger of being lost, Alex and Renias established this non-profit organization to preserve these ancient traditions and provide employment opportunities for unemployed youth, thereby cementing their legacy beyond their own adventures [3]."

In the African bush, facing lions and leopards on foot, the guide and tracker hold each other’s lives in their hands. This physical interdependence becomes a powerful metaphor for their emotional connection, illustrating how shared danger can forge unbreakable bonds [2].\nOvercoming Historical Divides The title plays on the idiom that “a leopard cannot change its spots,” arguing instead that humans can change. The book serves as a microcosm of the “Rainbow Nation” ideal, showing how two men—one privileged by the Apartheid system and the other dispossessed by it—dismantled the barriers of race and class to treat each other as equals [2].\nMentorship and Humility The story subverts the colonial trope of the white authority figure. Alex candidly writes about his early insecurities and the necessary journey of humbling himself to learn from Renias. The book elevates indigenous knowledge systems, presenting Renias not just as a skilled worker but as a mentor and philosopher of the natural world [3]."

Both the PDF and ePub formats seem to be closer the mobi format to the typesetting and layout you would get in a printed book. - (I’m not entirely sure what inspired me to purchase this book - I’m not, in general, a very artsy person. I guess it’s the idea that we can use algorithms to create something aesthetically pleasing. I learned a lot from this book, even though I have singularly failed to take what I learnt and actually try and create some art. At least I have a better understanding of how to go about it if I decide to give it a go somewhere down the line.\nThe book is composed of three parts. Part one looks at the overall concept of generative art and introduces the Processing platform which is the tool through will all the techniques in the book are implemented. Processing is a pretty cool platform for visualization - the Processing language is a variant of Java. However, there is now a Python mode for Processing - I generally tried to translate the code in the book to the Python version. Part 2 is about randomness and noise. The ‘aha moment’ for me here was understanding that perfectly straight lines and round circles are not as aesthetically pleasing as those produced by injecting a little noise into the process. Part 3 is about complexity and looks at emergence, autonomy and fractals. Overall a good read and an interesting diversion from enterprise programming."

    "section": "Key Points",
    "text": "Key Points\n\nThe Inevitability of Historical Revisionism\nEl Akkad argues that while Western governments and media currently offer broad support for the military actions in Gaza, history suggests a future shift in narrative. He posits that in the future, once the magnitude of the destruction is fully codified by history, the same institutions and individuals currently justifying the violence will claim they were opposed to it all along. He draws parallels to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, noting how difficult it is now to find people who admit to having supported that war, despite its overwhelming popularity at the time.\n\n\nThe Concept of the “Perfect Victim”\nThe author critiques the demand that oppressed populations must embody moral perfection to be deemed worthy of survival or empathy. He suggests that the West imposes a “means-testing” on human suffering, where the victims of state violence are scrutinized for any imperfection that might justify their destruction. El Akkad argues that this standard is never applied to the powerful, whose violence is often framed as unfortunate but necessary, whereas the resistance or mere existence of the oppressed is treated as a provocation.\n\n\nThe Sanitization of Language\nA significant portion of the essay analyzes the “linguistic gymnastics” employed by Western media. El Akkad highlights the use of the passive voice when describing Palestinian deaths (e.g., “people died” vs. “people were killed”) compared to the active voice used for Israeli deaths. He asserts that this specific deployment of language serves to obscure responsibility and creates a cognitive distance that allows the public to tolerate mass civilian casualties.\n\n“We are living through the era of the conditional sentence, the preamble, the qualification. We are in the age of the ‘but.’”\n\n\n\nThe Dissonance of Western Liberalism\nEl Akkad explores the psychological toll of living in the West while witnessing the destruction of one’s ancestral region funded by Western tax dollars. He critiques the hypocrisy of Western liberal democracies that champion human rights and international law rhetorically while offering material support for actions that violate those very laws. He describes the alienation felt by Arab-Americans and Muslims who realize their citizenship is conditional on their silence regarding foreign policy.\n\n\nThe Erasure of Context\nThe essay addresses the tendency to frame the conflict as beginning only at the moment of a specific attack (such as October 7), thereby erasing decades of historical context, occupation, and blockade. El Akkad argues that starting the clock at a moment convenient to the aggressor is a deliberate tactic to strip the violence of its root causes and present the response as purely defensive and devoid of political choice.\n\n\nThe Failure of “Bearing Witness”\nDrawing on his background as a war reporter, El Akkad questions the efficacy of journalism in the face of overwhelming ideological commitment to war. He challenges the traditional journalistic belief that “if people only knew” the extent of the suffering, the war would stop. He concludes that the facts are visible, but they are willfully ignored or recontextualized because the political will to continue the violence supersedes the humanitarian impulse to stop it."

    "text": "Introduction\n“The Art of Leadership: Small Things, Done Well” by Michael Lopp (often known by his blog pseudonym “Rands”) serves as a practical manifesto for engineering managers and leaders in the technology sector [3]. Drawing from his extensive experience at industry giants such as Netscape, Apple, and Slack, Lopp avoids high-level academic theory in favor of actionable, on-the-ground advice. The book is structured chronologically, mirroring the typical evolution of a leadership career. It guides the reader through three distinct stages: first as a Manager (Part I), then as a Director managing other managers (Part II), and finally as an Executive dealing with strategy and organizational culture (Part III) [3]. Lopp argues that effective leadership is not built on grand, dramatic gestures, but rather on the accumulation of small, consistent actions performed with care and integrity."

    "section": "Overview of the key points",
    "text": "Overview of the key points\nLopp provides several concrete strategies for navigating the complexities of management. A central tenet is that recruiting is job number one. He posits that building the team is the most critical activity a manager performs, suggesting that leaders should be prepared to dedicate up to 50% of their time to sourcing, interviewing, and selling candidates when in growth mode [2].\nAnother crucial skill is the ability to “Say the Hard Thing.” Lopp emphasizes that managers must overcome the natural fear of conflict to provide honest feedback. By making difficult conversations a routine part of the relationship rather than a rare, terrifying event, leaders build trust and prevent issues from festering [2].\nThe book also redefines the manager’s role as an information router. Lopp estimates that half of a manager’s job involves acquiring, assessing, and redistributing information to ensure the right people have the context they need to make decisions. This helps prevent “Meeting Blur” and organizational confusion [2].\nIn terms of meeting dynamics, Lopp advises leaders to “Act Last.” By withholding their opinion until others have spoken, leaders can read the room and gather unbiased perspectives before influencing the group with their authority [3].\nFinally, the concept of the “Blue Tape” list serves as a metaphor for maintaining standards. Just as blue painter’s tape left on a wall indicates unfinished work, leaders must be observant of small organizational imperfections and address them to set a standard of excellence for their team [3]."

    "section": "Overview of the key themes",
    "text": "Overview of the key themes\nPrincipled Consistency is a foundational theme throughout the book. Lopp argues that trust—the currency of leadership—is earned through predictable behavior over time. Employees need to know that their leader will react consistently to problems and opportunities, creating a stable environment where the team can focus on their work [3].\nThe transition from Maker to Manager is another significant theme. The book addresses the identity crisis many engineers face when they move from writing code (which offers the immediate gratification or “sugar high” of completion) to the more ambiguous, long-term work of building people and processes. Lopp validates this struggle and offers a roadmap for finding satisfaction in the achievements of the team rather than individual output.\nCulture as a “Creek” offers a realistic view of organizational change. Lopp describes culture not as something you can simply install or rewrite, but as a flowing body of water. A leader can nudge it or divert it slightly, but trying to stop or reverse it abruptly is often futile. Understanding the existing flow is a prerequisite to effectively guiding it in a new direction [3].\nUnderpinning all these themes is the necessity of Kindness. Lopp concludes that in a relatively small industry, one’s reputation is paramount. Being unfailingly kind and respectful is not just a moral choice but a strategic one for long-term career survival and success [2]."

By focusing on doing the “small things well”—from running effective 1:1s to spotting the “blue tape” in an organization—Michael Lopp provides a comprehensive manual for navigating the often messy human side of software engineering. It is an essential read for anyone looking to scale their leadership skills from the team level to the executive suite."

    "text": "Overview of the Story\nIn a departure from his usual criminal defense work, Mickey Haller takes on a “plaintiff’s lawyer” role, filing a lawsuit against a tech company named Tidalwaiv. The case centers on the tragic murder of a teenage girl by her ex-boyfriend, a crime allegedly encouraged by Tidalwaiv’s AI chatbot, “Clair” [1]. Haller contends that the company failed to implement necessary safety guardrails, prioritizing a multi-billion dollar buyout from a tech giant over user safety.\nThe legal battle is framed as a classic “David vs. Goliath” struggle. Tidalwaiv is on the verge of a massive acquisition, meaning the corporate defense—led by the formidable Mason twins—is aggressive and well-funded. To build his case, Haller must navigate mountains of discovery documents to find a “smoking gun” that proves negligence. He enlists the help of veteran journalist Jack McEvoy to investigate the company’s internal workings and locate a whistleblower [2]. The narrative unfolds in a gritty, fire-ravaged Los Angeles, adding an apocalyptic atmosphere to the courtroom drama."

After the wildfires destroy her home, she moves back in with Mickey, rekindling their complex relationship and adding an emotional layer to the story [2].\nHarry Bosch: The iconic detective makes only a minor appearance in this installment, along with his daughter Maddie, as the narrative focuses primarily on the Haller-McEvoy partnership [1]."

This is a quintessentially American disease - Europeans dont seem to suffer from it to the same extent. As for the rest of the world - well this is very much a first-world problem. Somehow over the years, the houses I have lived in have gotten bigger and the amount of stuff has grown to fill them. A reluctance to throw things away (just in case I might need it at some point in the future) means that my basement is full of boxes with the contents rotting away - well, not literally rotting away … ok, maybe in some cases literally rotting away. - (With a potential move to the UK looming, and with it the strong likelihood of having to downsize our family’s living accomodations, I thought this book would inspire me to do something about all my stuff and provide practical tips on how to do so. To some extent it did do that, but I found the book to be way too repetitive to be enjoyable. The material would make a great TedTalk or a long blog post, but as a book it was a chore to get through to the end.\nNote that the author is (I think) a Christian Pastor of some sort, and the book is sprinkled with biblical and religious references. I wasn’t bothered by it, but if that sort of thing rubs your the wrong way then it’s something to be aware of. Having said all that, I was convinced by the basic idea of a minimalist lifestyle. Now I just need to convince my wife :-)"

    "section": "Key Points",
    "text": "Key Points\n\nThe Evolutionary Drive for Togetherness\nWard posits that while the “survival of the fittest” often suggests solitary competition, social living offers distinct evolutionary advantages, primarily protection from predators, improved foraging efficiency, and reproductive access. He traces the origins of social behavior back to simple chemical signals in single-celled organisms.\n\n\nSwarm Intelligence and Simple Rules\nThe book details how complex group behaviors in lower-order animals, such as krill and locusts, emerge from individuals following simple local rules rather than central leadership.\n\nIn the case of locusts, swarming is driven partly by a “forced march” induced by cannibalism; individuals move forward to avoid being eaten by the locusts behind them.\nWard highlights the Antarctic krill, noting that their massive swarms constitute one of the largest biomasses on the planet, demonstrating the success of cooperative aggregation.\n\n\n\nThe Physics of Cooperation\nIn aquatic and aerial environments, animals like fish and birds utilize physics to conserve energy. Fish schools utilize “vortex surfing,” riding the eddies created by their neighbors to reduce drag. Similarly, bird flocks use V-formations to maximize aerodynamic lift.\n\n“By coordinating their movements, animals can overcome physical constraints that would limit a solitary individual.” (Context: Discussion on the hydrodynamics of fish schools).\n\n\n\nThe “Many Eyes” Theory\nA recurring theme is the vigilance advantage. In groups, individuals can spend less time scanning for predators and more time eating. Information transfer—such as a startle response—moves through a school of fish or flock of birds faster than the speed of a predator.\n\n\nAnimal Culture and Wisdom\nWard argues that “culture”—defined as information transmitted socially rather than genetically—exists in advanced animal societies.\n\nElephants and Orcas rely on matriarchs who hold ecological knowledge (e.g., location of water sources during droughts).\nSperm whales possess distinct vocal “dialects” specific to their clans, which serve as social identifiers and barriers, preventing interbreeding between different cultural groups.\n\n\n\nHierarchy and Politics in Primates\nThe book explores the shift from instinctive herding to calculated politics. In primate societies, physical strength is often less important than social capital. Grooming serves as a currency to build alliances, reduce tension, and secure position within the hierarchy.\n\n\nThe Human Super-Organism\nThe final section addresses human society. Ward argues that humans are the ultimate product of this evolutionary trajectory. While humans share the basic instincts of other social animals (tribalism, hierarchy), language and global connectivity have allowed for “hyper-cooperation.” However, the book notes that our social instincts, evolved for small groups, often clash with the scale of modern global society."

    "text": "Overview and Core Thesis\nMatthew Syed’s Black Box Thinking investigates the relationship between failure and success, arguing that the most effective individuals and organizations are those that treat errors as learning opportunities rather than embarrassments to be concealed. The title references the flight data recorders (black boxes) used in aviation to analyze accidents. Syed posits that aviation has achieved an impressive safety record by institutionalizing the practice of learning from mistakes, whereas other industries—most notably healthcare and the judicial system—often suffer from “closed loops” where errors are ignored or rationalized due to psychological self-protection and systemic blame."

    "section": "Key Concepts and Arguments",
    "text": "Key Concepts and Arguments\n\nThe Black Box Metaphor (Aviation vs. Healthcare)\nSyed contrasts the safety culture of the airline industry with the medical profession. In aviation, every accident is rigorously analyzed to prevent recurrence, creating a cumulative system of safety. Conversely, the author argues that healthcare often operates as a “closed loop” where mistakes are obfuscated to protect professional reputations.\n\nCase Study: The book details the death of Elaine Bromiley during a routine sinus operation due to a “cannot intubate, cannot ventilate” emergency. The clinicians froze, losing track of time while adhering to their initial plan despite its failure.\n\n\n“In the medical world, the hierarchy is far steeper. A junior nurse who spots a consultant making an error is far less likely to speak up than a co-pilot who sees a captain making a mistake.” (p. 26)\n\n\n\nClosed Loops vs. Open Loops\nSyed distinguishes between two systems of handling information:\n\nClosed Loops: Failure is not reported, or the data is misinterpreted to confirm pre-existing beliefs. No learning occurs, and the same errors are repeated.\nOpen Loops: Failures are acknowledged, reported, and analyzed. Feedback leads to systemic evolution.\n\n\n“A closed loop is where failure doesn’t lead to progress because information on errors and weaknesses is misinterpreted or ignored; an open loop is where feedback is rationally acted upon.” (p. 13)\n\n\n\nCognitive Dissonance and Self-Justification\nThe book explores the psychological mechanisms that prevent learning, primarily Leon Festinger’s theory of cognitive dissonance. When professionals (such as doctors or prosecutors) are confronted with evidence that they made a catastrophic mistake, it threatens their self-concept as competent and moral individuals. To resolve this psychological tension, they often reframe the facts rather than admit the error.\n\nExample: The book cites wrongful convictions where DNA evidence exonerates a suspect, yet prosecutors and police continue to insist on the suspect’s guilt to avoid admitting they imprisoned an innocent person.\n\n\n“When we are confronted with evidence that challenges our deeply held beliefs we are more likely to reframe the evidence than we are to alter our beliefs… We simply invent new reasons, new justifications, new explanations.” (p. 85)\n\n\n\nThe Logic of Failure (The Unilever Example)\nSyed illustrates the power of iterative failure through the story of Unilever solving a problem with clogged detergent nozzles. Mathematical experts failed to design a working nozzle from scratch (top-down theory). Biologists solved it by taking a working nozzle, creating ten slightly varied iterations, testing them, selecting the best, and repeating the process for 45 generations.\n\nArgument: Complexity is often best navigated through trial and error (evolution) rather than intellectual design.\n\n\n“Evolution is a process of testing and learning. It is a process of using failure to drive progress.” (p. 189)\n\n\n\nMarginal Gains\nThe book discusses the strategy of “aggregation of marginal gains,” popularized by Sir Dave Brailsford of British Cycling. This approach involves breaking down a large goal into tiny components and improving each by 1 percent. While individual changes may seem insignificant, the compound effect is transformative. This requires the humility to examine small imperfections.\n\n“Success is the sum of small efforts, repeated day in and day out.” (p. 211)\n\n\n\nThe Fixed vs. Growth Mindset\nDrawing on the work of psychologist Carol Dweck, Syed connects the willingness to engage with a “Black Box” system to individual mindsets.\n\nFixed Mindset: Believes intelligence and talent are static. Failures are viewed as a lack of ability, leading to defensiveness.\nGrowth Mindset: Believes abilities can be developed. Failure is viewed as essential feedback for improvement.\n\n\n\nPre-mortems and Systems Thinking\nSyed advocates for systems that anticipate failure before it happens. He references the “pre-mortem” technique (imagining a project has failed and working backward to determine why) as a way to mitigate the optimism bias that blinds teams to potential pitfalls."

Consequently, readers are biologically driven to ignore writing that requires excessive cognitive load. Effective writing rewards the reader’s brain by triggering the release of dopamine and other neurochemicals, making the act of reading feel pleasurable and efficient.\n\n“The brain is wired to consume information that helps us survive and thrive. It rewards us for learning.” (p. 2)\n\n\n“When you write in a way that aligns with the brain’s hardwiring, you captivate your readers.” (p. 5)"

    "section": "The Eight Secrets of Writing for Impact",
    "text": "The Eight Secrets of Writing for Impact\n\n1. Simplicity: Processing Fluency\nThe brain prefers information that is easy to process, a concept known as “processing fluency.” Complex sentences, jargon, and passive voice increase cognitive load, causing the reader’s attention to drift.\n\nScientific basis: Short sentences and familiar words require less glucose to process.\nApplication: Use active voice, keep sentences short, and place the subject and verb close together.\n\n\n“Simplicity isn’t just a stylistic choice; it’s a biological necessity. If you make the reader work too hard, they will tune out.” (p. 23)\n\n\n\n2. Specificity: Simulation\nWhen readers encounter concrete, specific details, the brain simulates the experience using the sensory and motor cortices. Abstract language remains processed only in the language centers, whereas specific language lights up the whole brain.\n\nScientific basis: Grounded cognition; the brain treats reading about an action similarly to performing the action.\nApplication: Swap abstract nouns for concrete ones (e.g., use “sprint” instead of “go quickly”).\n\n\n“Specifics awaken the brain’s sensory and motor cortices. They make the words leap off the page and into the reader’s mind.” (p. 51)\n\n\n\n3. Surprise: Predictive Coding\nThe brain is a prediction machine. It constantly anticipates what will happen next to save energy. When a prediction fails—when a writer disrupts a pattern—the brain releases dopamine to focus attention on the novelty.\n\nScientific basis: The reward prediction error; unexpected stimuli heighten neural plasticity and retention.\nApplication: Break established rhythms, use unexpected metaphors, and challenge conventional wisdom.\n\n\n“Surprise is the antidote to boredom. It jolts the brain out of autopilot and demands attention.” (p. 78)\n\n\n\n4. Stirring Language: Emotional Arousal**\nEmotion is a primary driver of attention and memory. Words with strong emotional connotations activate the amygdala, prioritizing that information for storage.\n\nScientific basis: Emotional arousal enhances memory consolidation in the hippocampus.\nApplication: Utilize “charged” words rather than neutral ones to evoke feelings, not just convey facts.\n\n\n“Emotion is the glue that makes memories stick. If you want your readers to remember what you wrote, you have to make them feel it.” (p. 104)\n\n\n\n5. Seductiveness: Curiosity and Anticipation\nThis strategy leverages the brain’s desire to close information gaps. By withholding information or posing questions, the writer creates a state of anticipation (wanting) rather than just satisfaction (liking).\n\nScientific basis: The “wanting” system involves dopamine, which drives the pursuit of information.\nApplication: Use foreshadowing, pose questions early in the text, and structure writing as a mystery to be solved.\n\n\n“Anticipation is a powerful driver of behavior. By keeping the reader guessing, you keep them reading.” (p. 132)\n\n\n\n6. Smart Thinking: Insight\nHumans have an innate drive for competence and mastery. Providing readers with “Aha!” moments triggers deep satisfaction. The brain rewards the acquisition of new, useful knowledge that aids survival or social standing.\n\nScientific basis: Insight stimulates the brain’s reward circuit, specifically the nucleus accumbens.\nApplication: Offer distinct takeaways, generalize specific stories into universal truths, and validate the reader’s intelligence.\n\n\n“Readers want to feel smart. Give them insights that make them see the world differently.” (p. 159)\n\n\n\n7. Social Connection: Relatability\nHumans are an ultra-social species. The brain defaults to thinking about other people when at rest. Writing that feels personal or conversational engages the medial prefrontal cortex, which is involved in social cognition.\n\nScientific basis: Theory of Mind; readers unconsciously attempt to determine the writer’s intent and personality.\nApplication: Use the second person (“you”), show the author’s personality, and write in a conversational tone.\n\n\n“Writing is a relationship. Connect with your reader as you would a friend.” (p. 185)\n\n\n\n8. Storytelling: Neural Coupling\nStories are the most effective way to transmit information because they engage multiple brain regions simultaneously. Through “neural coupling,” the listener’s brain activity mirrors that of the storyteller.\n\nScientific basis: Narrative transportation; stories synchronize the brains of the writer and reader.\nApplication: Structure non-fiction with a beginning, middle, and end; use character-driven narratives to explain abstract concepts.\n\n\n“Story is the brain’s native language. It’s how we make sense of the world.” (p. 212)"

    "text": "Somebody’s Daughter by Ashley C. Ford\n\n\nisbn-13: 9781250305978\nAudible\nThis is not a book I would normally read, but it was assigned reading in a book club I joined in Facebook, so I thought I’d give it a try. I actually got a lot out of reading about the coming of age of a young African-American girl. It certainly gave me insight into points of view and experiences I had not come across before.\nOstensibly the “somebody” of the title is Ford’s father who has been in jail for most of her childhood, but the book really highlights Ford’s troubled relationship with her mother.\nI was reminded of Educated by Tara Westover in many way as I was reading this, but Ford’s experiences and troubles are tame compared to Westover’s. This might be unfair, but Ford comes across as a little immature - I wonder if her perspective would change if she herself becomes a mother.\nNevertheless, a worthwhile read.\nPublisher’s Description: ““Sure to be one of the best memoirs of 2021.” —Kirkus Reviews, starred review “So clear, sharp, and smooth that the reader sees, in vivid focus, Ford’s complicated childhood, brilliant mind, and golden heart. Ford is a writer for the ages, and Somebody’s Daughter will be a book of the year.” —Glennon Doyle, #1 New York Times bestselling author of Untamed “Ford’s wrenchingly brilliant memoir is truly a classic in the making. The writing is so richly observed and so suffused with love and yearning that I kept forgetting to breathe while reading it.” —John Green, #1 New York Times bestselling author One of the most prominent voices of her generation debuts with an extraordinarily powerful memoir: the story of a childhood defined by the looming absence of her incarcerated father. Through poverty, adolescence, and a fraught relationship with her mother, Ashley Ford wishes she could turn to her father for hope and encouragement. There are just a few problems: he’s in prison, and she doesn’t know what he did to end up there. She doesn’t know how to deal with the incessant worries that keep her up at night, or how to handle the changes in her body that draw unwanted attention from men. In her search for unconditional love, Ashley begins dating a boy her mother hates. When the relationship turns sour, he assaults her. Still reeling from the rape, which she keeps secret from her family, Ashley desperately searches for meaning in the chaos. Then, her grandmother reveals the truth about her father’s incarceration . . . and Ashley’s entire world is turned upside down. Somebody’s Daughter steps into the world of growing up a poor, Black girl in Indiana with a family fragmented by incarceration, exploring how isolating and complex such a childhood can be. As Ashley battles her body and her environment, she embarks on a powerful journey to find the threads between who she is and what she was born into, and the complicated familial love that often binds them.”"

    "text": "Ubiquity: Why Catastrophes Happen by Mark Buchanan - (Kindle)\n\n\nOne of the books that were covered by the Farnam Street Virtual Reading Group in 2017. The book gave an interesting non-technical introduction to Critical State Theory and how it can be used to explain phenomena as diverse as earthquakes, forest fires, extinction events, financial markets and wars. Focusing initially on earthquakes, the book explains how scientists have singularly failed to come up with a theory that can predict when and where a major earhtquake will occur. Instead, scientists have found that earthquakes in general follow a power-law that describes how earthquake magnitude relates to frequency - the larger the earthquake, the less likely it is to occur. However, any size of earhquake can occur at any given time. How I understood it, is that complex systems with many interacting elements behave in a highly-path dependent manner and can build up to a critical state where a small ‘nudge’ can cause a very large change in the overall behavior, but could also just precipitate a very small change.\nThis book definitely left me looking at the world in a different way. The concepts have many potential repercussions to how we see the world and how we interact with it. A book to come back to for a second read."

    "text": "Model\nThe book consists of 25 steps, grouped into 5 major stages, that all together form a learning pathm which incrementally builds the reader’s knowledge of the blockchain.\n\nStage 1: Terminology and Technical Foundations\n\nStep 1: Thinking in layers and aspects\n\nSystems can be partioned into application vs implementation and functional vs non-functional aspects.\nIntegrity is a major non-functional aspect, and has three major components:\n\nData Integrity\nBehavioural Integrity\nSecurity\n\nMost software failures are the result of violated system integrity.\n\n\n\nStep 2: Software Architecture and it’s relation to the Blockchain\n\nSoftware architectures can be centralized or distributed.\nThe blockchain is part of the implementation of a distributed software system*\nThe purpose of the blockchain is to achieve and maintain the integrity of a distributed software system\n\n\n\nStep 3: Recognizing the potential of peer-to-peer systems\n\nPeer-to-peer systems are a specific type of distributed system that allow direct interactions between contractual partners rather than indirect interactions through a middleman.\n\n\n\n\nStage 2: Why the Blockchain is needed\n\nStep 4: Discovering the core problem\n\nIntegrity and trust are major concerns of peer-to-peer (P2P) systems\nMajor integrity threats in P2P systems are:\n\nTechnical failures\nMalicious peers\n\nThe blockchain addresses integrity of a purely distributed P2P system comprised of an unknown number of peers with unknown reliability and trustworthiness.\n\n\n\nStep 5: Disambiguating the term - 4 ways to define the blockchain*\n\nThe term blockchain can be used as:\n\na name for a data-structure: data in units called blocks, connected together like a chain.\na name for an algorithm: the sequence of intructions that negotiated the information content of many blockchain-data-structured in a P2P system.\na name for a suite of technologies: a combination of blockchain data-structure, algorithm and cryptographic and security technlogies that together achieve integrity in a P2P system.\nan umbrella term for purely distributed P2P systems with a common application area\n\nManaging ans clarifying ownership is the most prominent application of the blockchain, but not the only one.\nThe blockchain is a purely distributed peer-to-peer system of ledgers that utilizes a software unit that consist of an algorithm, which negotiates the informational content of ordered and connected blocks of data together with cryptographic and security technologies in order to achieve and maintain its integrity.\n\n\n\nStep 6: Understanding the nature of ownership\n\nProof of ownership has 3 elements:\n\nIdentification of the owner\nIdentification of the object being owned\nMapping the owner to the object\n\nMapping between owners and object can be maintained in a ledger.\nHaving one ledger is risky as it can be damaged, destroyed or forged.\nCan utilize a group of independent ledgers and define ownership based in that version of reality on which the majority of ledgers agree.\nThe blockchain algorith is responsible for letting individual nodes in a blockchain collectively arrive at one consitent version of the state of ownership.\nCryptography is used to ensure identity, authentication and authorization.\nIntegrity in a distributed P2P system of ledgers is found in it’s ability to make true statements about ownership and to ensure only the owner can transfer their property rights to others.\n\n\n\nStep 7: Spending Money Twice - Examining a vulnerability of distributed P2P systems\n\nDouble-spending can be seen as a problem of maintaining data consistency in distributed P2P systems.\nThe blockchain is a means to solving the double spending problem\n\n\n\n\nStage 3: How the Blockchain works\n\nStep 8: Planning the blockchain\n\nThe following tasks are necessary to design a distributed P2P system of ledgers for managing ownership:\n\nDescribing ownership\nProtecting ownership from unauthorized access\nStoring transaction data\nPreparing ledgers to be distributed in an untrustworthy environment\nDistributing the ledgers\nAdding and verifying new transactions to the ledgers\nDeciding which ledgers represent the truth\n\n\n\n\nStep 9: Documenting Ownership\n\nTransaction data provide the following information for describing a transfer of ownership:\n\nAn identifier of the account who initiates the transaction and is to transfer ownership to another account\nAn identifier of that account that is to receive ownership\nThe amount of the goods to be transferred\nThe time the transaction is to be done\nA fee to be paid to the system for executing the transaction\nA proof that the owner of the account who hands off ownership agrees with that transfer\n\nThe complete history of transaction data is an audit trail that provides evidence of how people acquired and handed off ownership.\nAny transaction not being part of that history is regarded as if it never happened.\nA transaction is executed by adding it to the history of transaction data and allowing it to influence the result of aggregating them.\nThe order in which transaction data are added to the history must be preserved in order to yield identical results when aggregating these data.\nIn order to maintain integrity, only those transaction data are added to the blockchain-data-structure that fulfill the following three criteria:\n\nFormal correctness\nSemantic correctness\nAuthorization\n\n\n\n\nStep 10: Hashing Data\n\nHash functions transform any kind of data into a number of fixed length, regardless of the size of the input data.\nThere are many different hash functions that differ among others with respect to the length of the hash value they produce.\nCryptographic hash functions are an important group of hash functions that create digital fingerprints for any kind of data.\nCryptographic hash functions exhibit the following properties:\n\nProvide hash values for any kind of data quickly\nDeterministic\nPseudorandom\nOne-way usage\nCollision resistant\n\nApplication of hash functions to data can be accomplished by using the following patterns:\n\nRepeated hashing\nIndependent hashing\nCombined hashing\nSequential hashing\nHierarchical hashing\n\n\n\n\nStep 11: Hashing in the real world\n\nHash values can be used:\n\nTo compare data\nTo detect whether data that were supposed to stay unchanged have been altered\nTo refer to data in a change-sensitive manner\nTo store a collection of data in a change-sensitive manner\nTo create computationally expensive tasks\n\n\n\n\nStep 12: Identifying and protecting user accounts\n\nThe major goal of cryptography is to protect data from being accessed by unauthorized people.\nThe major cryptographic activities are:\n\nEncryption: Protecting data by turning them into cypher text by utilizing a cryptographic key\nDecryption: Turning cypher text back into useful data by utilizing a matching cryptographic key\nAsymmetric cryptography always uses two complementary keys: cypher text created with one of these keys can only be decrypted with the other key and vice versa.\n\nWhen utilizing asymmetric cryptography in real life, these keys are typically called the public key and private key in order to highlight their role. The public key is shared with everyone, while the private key is kept secret. For this reason, asymmetric cryptography is also called public-private-key cryptography.\nThere are two classical use cases of public and private keys:\n\nEveryone uses the public key to encrypt data that can only be decrypted by the owner of the corresponding private key. This is the digital equivalent to a public mailbox where everyone can put letters in but only the owner can open it.\nThe owner of the private key uses it to encrypt data that can be decrypted by everyone who possesses the corresponding public key. This is the digital equivalent to a public notice board that proves authorship.\n\nThe blockchain uses asymmetric cryptography in order to achieve two goals:\n\nIdentifying accounts: User accounts are public cryptographic keys.\nAuthorizing transactions: The owner of the account who hands off ownership creates a piece of cypher text with the corresponding private key. This piece of cypher text can be verified by using the corresponding public key, which happens to be the number of the account that hands off ownership.\n\n\n\n\nStep 13: Authorizing transactions\n\nDigital signatures are the digital equivalent to handwritten signatures and serve two purposes:\n\nIdentify its author uniquely\nState agreement of its author with the content of a document and authorize its execution\n\nIn the blockchain, digital signatures of transactions are cryptographic hash values of transaction data encrypted with the private key that corresponds to the account that hands off ownership.\nDigital signatures in the blockchain can be trace back uniquely to one specific private key and to one specific transaction in one process.\n\n\n\nStep 14: Storing transaction data\n\nThe blockchain-data-structure is a specific kind of data structure that is made up of ordered units called blocks.\nEach block of the blockchain-data-structure consists of a block header and a Merkle tree that contains transaction data.\nThe blockchain-data-structure consists of two major data structures: an ordered chain of block headers and Merkle trees.\nOne can imagine the ordered chain of block headers as being the digital equivalent to an old-fashioned library card catalog, where the individual catalog cards are sorted according to the order in which they were added to the catalog.\nHaving each block header referencing its preceding block header preserves the order of the individual block headers and blocks, respectively, that make up the blockchain-data-structure.\nEach block header in the blockchain-data-structure is identified by its cryptographic hash value and contains a hash reference to its preceding block header and a hash reference to the application-specific data whose order it maintains.\nThe hash reference to the application-specific data is typically the root of a Merkle tree that maintains hash references to the application-specific data.\n\n\n\nStep 15: Using the data store - chaining blocks of data\n\nThe steps to be performed in order to add new transaction data to the blockchain-data-structure are:\n\nCreate a new Merkle tree that contains all new transaction data to be added.\nCreate a new block header that contains both a hash reference to its preceding header and the root of the Merkle tree that contains the new transaction data.\nCreate a hash reference to the new block header, which is now the current head of the blockchain-data-structure.\n\nChanging data in the blockchain-data-structure requires renewing all hash references starting with the one that directly points to the manipulated data and ending with the head of the whole blockchain-data-structure as well as all hash references in between them.\nThe blockchain-data-structure pursues a radical all-or-nothing approach when it comes to changing its data: One either changes the whole data structure completely starting from the point that causes the change until the head of the whole chain or one better leave it unchanged in the first place.\nAll half-hearted, halfway through, or partial changes will leave the whole blockchain-data-structure in an inconsistent state, which will be detected easily and quickly.\nChanging the blockchain-data-structure completely is a very elaborate process on purpose.\nThe high sensitivity of the blockchain-data-structure regarding changes is due to the properties of hash references.\n\n\n\nStep 16: Protecting the data store - discovering the power of immutability\n\nThe blockchain protects the history of transaction data from manipulation and forgery by storing transaction data in an immutable data store.\nThe history of a transaction is made immutable by utilizing two ideas:\n\nStoring the transaction data in the change-sensitive blockchain-data-structure, which when being changed requires rewriting the data structure starting at the point that causes the change until the head of the whole chain.\nRequiring the solution of a hash puzzle for writing, rewriting, or adding every single block header in the blockchain-data-structure.\n\nThe hash puzzle is unique for each block header because it depends on its unique content.\nThe need to rewrite the blockchain-data-structure when it is changed and the costs of doing so make it unattractive to manipulate the history of transaction data in the first place.\nRequiring the solution of a hash puzzle for every writing, rewriting or adding of block headers in the blockchain-data-structure turns is into an append-only data store.\nA block header contains at least the following data:\n\nA hash reference to the header of its preceding block\nThe root of a Merkle tree that contains transaction data\nThe difficulty of its hash puzzle\nThe time when solving the hash puzzle was started\nThe nonce that solves the hash puzzle\n\n\n\n\nStep 17: Distributing the data store among peers\n\nComputers in a distributed peer-to-peer system communicate with one another via a digital network.\nDue to the omnipresence of the Internet, it is compelling to create a distributed peer-to-peer system by connecting the individual nodes via the Internet.\nA peer-to-peer system that uses the Internet as a medium of communication is characterized by the following facts:\n\nThe computers are connected with one another via the Internet.\nEach computer is identified by a unique address.\nEach computer can disconnect and reconnect to the system at any given time.\nEach computer independently maintains a list of peers with which it communicates.\nCommunication between nodes is based on messages.\nMessages are sent from one node to another over the Internet by using their unique addresses.\n\nDue to the adversaries of networks, the communication among the nodes is characterized by the following facts:\n\nMessages are not guaranteed to arrive at the addressees, but they may get lost instead.\nMessages may arrive more than once.\nMessages may arrive in a different order than they were sent.\n\nThe blockchain counteracts the adversaries of communicating over an unreliable network in the following ways:\n\nMessages are sent in a gossip style. Every node that receives a message will forward it to the peers it communicates with, which in turn will handle the message in the same way.\nDuplicates of transactions or blocks are identified and filtered out based on their cryptographic hash values.\nEach node can order the received information because transaction data and block headers contain time stamps.\n\nThe communication among the computers that make up the peer-to-peer system serves the following three purposes:\n\nKeeping existing connections alive\nEstablishing new connections\nDistributing new information\n\nForwarding ownership-related information happens on three occasions:\n\nIn an ongoing fashion by forwarding new transaction data and new blocks to all nodes that are connected to the system\nAs an update for nodes that reconnect to the system after being disconnected for a while\nAs part of the on-boarding procedure that transfers a copy of the whole up-to-date version of the blockchain-data-structure to the new nodes to ensure that they become full-fledged nodes after joining the system\n\n\n\n\nStep 18: Verifying and adding transactions\n\nThe blockchain-algorithm is a series of rules and instructions that governs the way in which transaction data are processed and added to the system.\nThe challenge solved by the blockchain-algorithm is to keep the system open to everyone while ensuring that only valid and authorized transactions are added.\nThe blockchain-algorithm utilizes the carrot-and-stick approach, combined with competition and peer control.\nThe major idea of the blockchain-algorithm is to allow all nodes of the system to act as supervisors of their peers and reward them for adding valid and authorized transactions and for finding errors in the work of others.\nDue to the rules of the blockchain-algorithm, all nodes of the system have an incentive to process transactions correctly and to supervise and point out any mistakes made by the other peers.”\nThe blockchain-algorithm is based on the following concepts:\n\nValidation rules for transaction data and block headers\nReward for submitting valid blocks\nPunishment for counteracting the integrity of the system\nCompetition among peers for earning reward based on processing speed and quality\nPeer control\n\nThe rules of the competition establish a two-step rhythm that governs the work of every node in the network. At any given point in time, all nodes of the system are in either of the two phases:\n\nEvaluating a new block that was created by others\nTrying hard to be the next node that creates a new block that has to be evaluated by all others\n\nThe working rhythm is imposed by the arrival of messages at the individual nodes.\nThe majority of honest nodes and their striving for reward will outweigh the attempts of dishonest nodes to counteract the integrity of the system.\n\n\n\nStep 19: Choosing a transaction history\n\nDelays in sending new blocks across the network or two nodes creating new blocks nearly at the same time cause the blockchain-data-structure to grow into the shape of a tree or a columnar cactus with branches that arise from a common trunk that represent conflicting versions of the transaction history.\nSelecting an identical version of the transaction history is a collective decision-making problem.\nDistributed consensus is an agreement among the members of a purely distributed peer-to-peer system in a collective decision-making problem.\nThe collective decision-making problem of the blockchain is characterized by the following facts:\n\nAll nodes operate in the identical environment, consisting of the network, nodes that maintain their individual copies of the blockchain-data-structure, and the blockchain-algorithm that governs the behavior of the nodes.\nThe decision-making problem is to select the identical transaction history across all nodes.\nAll nodes strive to maximize their individual income earned as a reward for adding new valid blocks to the blockchain-data-structure.\nIn order to achieve their goals, all nodes send their new blocks to all their peers to have them examined and accepted. As a result, each nodes leaves its individual footprint in the environment that is the collectively maintained blockchain-data-structure.\nAll nodes use the identical criterion for selecting a history of transaction data.\n\nThe longest-chain-criterion states that each node independently chooses the path of the tree-shaped blockchain-data-structure that contains the most blocks.\nThe heaviest-chain-criterion states that each node independently chooses that path of the tree-shaped blockchain-data-structure that has the highest aggregated difficulty.\nSelecting one path of the tree-shaped blockchain-data-structure has the following consequences:\n\nOrphan blocks\nReclaimed reward\nClarifying ownership\nReprocessing of transactions\nA growing common trunk\nEventual consistency\nRobustness against manipulations\n\nThe deeper down the authoritative chain a block is located:\n\nThe further in the past it was added\nThe more time has passed since its inclusion in the blockchain-data-structure\nThe more common effort has been spent on adding subsequent blocks\nThe less it is affected by random changes of the blocks that belong to the longest chain\nThe less likely it will be abandoned\nThe more accepted it is by the nodes of the system\nThe more anchored it is in the common history of the nodes\n\nThe fact that certainty concerning the inclusion of blocks in the authoritative chain increases as time goes by and as more blocks are added eventually is called eventually consistency.\nA 51 percent attack is an attempt to gather or control the majority of the whole voting power in a collective decision-making process with the goal to turn blocks that are part of the authoritative chain into orphan blocks and establish a new authoritative chain that contains a transaction history that is more favorable from the attackers point of view.\nA 51 percent attack has the following characteristics:\n\nEconomically: Changing the allocation of ownership rights by changing the collective history of transaction data.\nDecision making: Gathering the majority of voting power in order to enforce a desired result.\nTechnically: Undermining the integrity of the system.\nArchitecturally: Establish at least temporarily a hidden element of centrality that changes the state of the system.\n\n\n\n\nStep 20: Paying for Integrity\n\nThe blockchain utilizes fees for compensating its peers for contributing to the integrity of the system.\nThe instrument of payment used to compensate peers has an impact on major aspects of the blockchain such as:\n\nIntegrity\nOpenness\nThe distributed nature\nThe philosophy of the system\nDesirable properties of an instrument of payment for compensating peers are:\nBeing available in digital form\nBeing accepted in the real world\nBeing accepted in all countries\nNot being the subject to capital movement restrictions\nBeing trustworthy\nNot being controlled by one single central organization or state\n\nA cryptocurrency is an independent digital currency whose ownership is managed by a blockchain that uses it as an instrument of payment for compensating its peers for maintaining the integrity of the system.\n\n\n\nStep 21: Bringing the pieces together\n\nThe blockchain is a purely distributed peer-to-peer system that addresses the following aspects of managing ownership:\n\nDescribing ownership: History of Transaction Data\nProtecting ownership: Digital Signature\nStoring transaction data: Blockchain-Data-Structure\nPreparing ledgers for being distributed: Immutability\nDistributing ledgers: Gossip-Style Information Forwarding Through a Network\nProcessing new transactions: Blockchain-Algorithm\nDeciding which ledger represents the truth: Distributed Consensus\n\nAnalyzing the blockchain involves the following aspects:\n\nThe application goal\nIts properties\nIts internal functioning\n\nThe blockchain has two application goals:\n\nClarifying ownership\nTransferring ownership\n\nThe blockchain fulfills its application goals while exhibiting the following qualities:\n\nHighly available\nCensorship proof\nReliable\nOpen\nPseudoanonymous\nSecure\nResilient\nEventually consistent\nKeeping integrity\n\nInternally the blockchain consists of components that are either specific or agnostic to the application goal of managing ownership.\nThe application-specific components of the blockchain are:\n\nOwnership logic\nTransaction data\nTransaction processing logic\nTransaction security\n\nThe application-agnostic components are:\n\nThe blockchain-technology-suite\nThe purely distributed peer-to-peer architecture\n\nThe blockchain-technology-suite consists of:\n\nStorage logic\nConsensus logic\nData processing logic\nAsymmetric cryptography\n\n\n\n\n\nStage 4: Limitations and how to overcome them\n\nStep 22: Seeing the limitations\n\nThe openness of the blockchain and the absence of any form of central control are the fundamentals of its functioning but can also cause limitations for its adoption.\nMajor technical limitations of the blockchain are:\n\nLack of privacy\nThe security model\nLimited scalability\nHigh costs\nHidden centrality\nLack of flexibility\nCritical size\n\nThe most important nontechnical limitations of the blockchain are:\n\nLack of legal acceptance\nLack of user acceptance\nTechnical limitations of the blockchain can be overcome by improving the existing technology or by introducing conceptual changes.\nThe nontechnical limitations of the blockchain can be overcome by educational and legislative initiatives.\n\n\n\n\nStep 23: Reinventing the Blockchain\n\nThe blockchain inherently contains the following conflicts:\n\nTransparency vs. privacy: On the one hand, transparency is needed for clarifying ownership and preventing double spending, but on the other hand, its users require privacy.\nSecurity vs. speed: On the one hand, protecting the history of transaction data from being manipulated is done by utilizing the computationally expensive proof of work, but on the other hand, speed and scalability are required in most commercial contexts.\n\nThe transparency vs. privacy conflict has its root in the allocation of reading access rights to the blockchain-data-structure.\nThe security vs. speed conflict has its root in the allocation of writing access rights to the blockchain-data-structure.\nSolving the transparency vs. privacy conflict led to the following versions of the blockchain:\n\nPublic blockchains grant reading access and the right to create new transactions to all users or nodes.\nPrivate blockchains limit reading access and the right to create new transactions to a preselected group of users or nodes.\n\nSolving the security vs. speed conflict led to the following versions of the blockchain:\n\nPermissionless blockchains grant writing access to everyone. Every user or node can verify transaction data and create and add new blocks to the blockchain-data-structure.\nPermissioned blockchains grant writing access only to a limited group of preselected nodes or users that are identified as trustworthy through an on-boarding process.\n\nCombining these restrictions pairwise led to the emergence of four different kinds of blockchains.\nRestricting reading or writing access results in consequences on the following properties of the blockchain:\n\nThe peer-to-peer architecture\nThe distributed nature\nIts purpose\n\nThe blockchain-technology-suite causes value even in restricted environments for the following reasons:\n\nThe number of nodes can vary due to technical failures or downtime.\nEvery distributed system faces the adversaries of networks that make communication on the level of individual messages unreliable.\nEven an on-boarding process may not guarantee the trustworthiness of nodes at a 100 percent level.\nEven trustworthy nodes may yield wrong results due to technical failures.\n\n\n\n\n\nStage 5: Using the Blockchain, Summary and Outlook\n\nStep 24: Using the Blockchain\n\nThe blockchain can be considered a purely distributed data store with additional properties such as being immutable, append-only, ordered, time-stamped, and eventually consistent.\nBeing a generic data store means that the blockchain can store a wide range of data, which in turn makes it usable in a wide range of application areas.\nBased on its properties, we can identify the following generic-use patterns of the blockchain:\n\nProof of existence\nProof of nonexistence\nProof of time\nProof of order\nProof of identity\nProof of authorship\nProof of ownership\n\nSpecific application areas of the blockchain that have already received attention or may receive attention in the future are:\n\nPayments\nCryptocurrencies\nMicropayments\nDigital assets\nDigital identity\nNotary services\nCompliance and audit\nTax\nVoting\nRecord management\n\nWhen analyzing specific blockchain applications or blockchain services, some questions need to be answered:\n\nWhat kind of blockchain is used?\nAre the requirements for using the blockchain fulfilled?\nWhat is the added value of using a purely distributed peer-to-peer system?\nWhat is the application idea?\nWhat is the business case?\nHow are peers compensated for contributing resources to the system?\n\n\n\n\nStep 25: Summarizing and going further\n\nThe blockchain has been and will continue to be the subject of further improvements and developments such as variations in its implementation, improving efficiency, improving scalability, and conceptual advances.\nSmart contracts, zero-knowledge proofs, and alternative ways to achieve consensus are major areas of conceptual advancement of the blockchain.\nBesides it technical merits, the blockchain may be honored for the following long-term accomplishments:\n\nDisintermediation\nAutomation\nStandardization\nStreamlining processes\nIncreased processing speed\nCost reduction\nShift toward trust in protocols and technology\nMaking trust a commodity\nIncreased technology awareness\n\nPossible disadvantages of the blockchain are:\n\nLack of privacy\nLoss of personal responsibility\nLoss of jobs\nReintermediation\n\nPossible usages of the blockchain to be seen in the future are:\n\nLimited enthusiast projects\nLarge-scale commercial projects\nGovernmental projects"

    "text": "The Prosperity Paradox: How Innovation Can Lift Nations Out of Poverty by Clayton M. Christensen\n\n\nisbn-13: 9780062851826\nAudible\nPublisher’s Description\nClayton M. Christensen, the author of such business classics as The Innovator’s Dilemma and the New York Times bestseller How Will You Measure Your Life, and co-authors Efosa Ojomo and Karen Dillon reveal why so many investments in economic development fail to generate sustainable prosperity, and offers a groundbreaking solution for true and lasting change. Global poverty is one of the world’s most vexing problems. For decades, we’ve assumed smart, well-intentioned people will eventually be able to change the economic trajectory of poor countries. From education to healthcare, infrastructure to eradicating corruption, too many solutions rely on trial and error. Essentially, the plan is often to identify areas that need help, flood them with resources, and hope to see change over time. But hope is not an effective strategy. Clayton M. Christensen and his co-authors reveal a paradox at the heart of our approach to solving poverty. While noble, our current solutions are not producing consistent results, and in some cases, have exacerbated the problem. At least twenty countries that have received billions of dollars’ worth of aid are poorer now. Applying the rigorous and theory-driven analysis he is known for, Christensen suggests a better way. The right kind of innovation not only builds companies—but also builds countries. The Prosperity Paradox identifies the limits of common economic development models, which tend to be top-down efforts, and offers a new framework for economic growth based on entrepreneurship and market-creating innovation. Christensen, Ojomo, and Dillon use successful examples from America’s own economic development, including Ford, Eastman Kodak, and Singer Sewing Machines, and shows how similar models have worked in other regions such as Japan, South Korea, Nigeria, Rwanda, India, Argentina, and Mexico. The ideas in this book will help companies desperate for real, long-term growth see actual, sustainable progress where they’ve failed before. But The Prosperity Paradox is more than a business book; it is a call to action for anyone who wants a fresh take for making the world a better and more prosperous place."

The writing could do with some editing, but the story is an unexpectedly thrilling account of getting to the K2 basecamp and back. I have no particular interest in climbing and I really enjoyed this book, so if you have a passion for climbing I’m sure you’ll love it. It made me realize this particular trip is something I will never want to subject myself to!\nPublisher’s Description: “Not many people know that Pakistan is home to 108 peaks above 7,000 meters (22,966 ft.) and many more above 6,000 meters (19,685 ft.). Not only that, 5 out of 14 peaks above 8,000 meters (26,247 ft.) of our planet are in Pakistan. Trek with me to the remote, rugged, and beautiful mountain range, Karakoram of Pakistan, where most of these gorgeous peaks stand tall. Know the ins and outs of the daily drill while you trek all the way to see K2, the second highest peak in the world, via the Concordia Trek on the Baltoro Glacier and then return via Gondogoro La and Hushe of the Karakoram range of Pakistan. Tag along! We will trek more than 85 miles into the thin fresh air reaching approximately 19,000 feet. Trek and camp on the wild glaciers with me. We will travel through the concentration of highest peaks of the world. There are Glaciers so magnificent that they can be seen from space. This book is your user manual on how to see K2 and come back alive. If there would be a place in the world where Mountain Gods would live then the Concordia of the Karakoram would be their throne. This book will humbly take you to the thrones of the Mountain Gods, Concordia-K2-Gondogoro La of Pakistan, and bring you back.”"

There’s only a thin thread connecting the chapters in this book which are more like a series of vignettes about different aspects of the medical profession. Some chapters are really compelling, some only mildly interesting. There’s no grand theory or overarching narrative though.\nChapter 1: “On Washing Hands” discusses why the discovery by Semmelweis in 1847 that having doctors wash their hands in between deliveries greatly reduced infections took so long to be adopted by the medical community as standard practice. Introduces the concept of positive deviance\nChapter 2: “The Mop Up” shows the difficulties faced by doctors on the front line of polio containment in India.\nChapter 3: “Casualties of War” covers the ongoing improvement in care for soldiers wounded on the battlefield. Chapter 4: “Naked” covers exam room etiquette especially when performing intimate examinations and whether having ‘chaperones’ improves the situation or not.\nChapter 5: “What Doctors Owe” discusses malpractice suits which pits doctors against insurers.\nChapter 6: “Piecework” concerns how much doctors earn and their relationship with the health insurance industry.\nChapter 7: “The Doctors of the Death Chamber” discusses death by lethal injection and the doctors that administer or oversee the procedure and the related ethics.\nChapter 8: “On Fighting” discussed the pros and cons of fighting to treat or save patients when the side-effects can be debilitating or the chances of success are slim.\nChapter 9: “The Score” dives into childbirth and the complications that can arrive. It discusses the invention of the forceps and why it is so rarely used nowadays. The score is a reference to the Apgar Score, a way of ‘measuring’ a child’s chances of survival after birth and the different means that doctors have come up with to improve those chances.\nChapter 10: “The Bell Curve” discusses hospital performance in combatting different diseases and what some hospitals do so that they outperform others.\nChapter 11: “For Performance” highlights difficulties faced by doctors in Indian hospitals where patients often die of treatable causes because of the lack of appropriate instruments.\nAfterword: “Suggestions for Becoming a Positive Deviant” - see this summary\nPublisher’s Description: “Explores the efforts of physicians to close the gap between best intentions and best performance in the face of insurmountable obstacles, discussing such topics as the ethical considerations of lethal injections, malpractice, and surgical errors.”"

The media loves to report on millions, billions, and trillions, but frequently makes basic mistakes or presents such numbers in misleading ways. And misunderstanding numbers can have serious consequences, since they can deceive us in many of our most important decisions, including how to vote, what to buy, and whether to make a financial investment. In this short, accessible, enlightening, and entertaining book, leading computer scientist Brian Kernighan teaches anyone—even diehard math-phobes—how to demystify the numbers that assault us every day. With examples drawn from a rich variety of sources, including journalism, advertising, and politics, Kernighan demonstrates how numbers can mislead and misrepresent. In chapters covering big numbers, units, dimensions, and more, he lays bare everything from deceptive graphs to speciously precise numbers. And he shows how anyone—using a few basic ideas and lots of shortcuts—can easily learn to recognize common mistakes, determine whether numbers are credible, and make their own sensible estimates when needed. Giving you the simple tools you need to avoid being fooled by dubious numbers, Millions, Billions, Zillions is an essential survival guide for a world drowning in big—and often bad—data.”"

The Capitol Game It was the deal of the decade, if not the century. A small, insignificant company on the edge of bankruptcy had discovered an alchemist’s dream; a miraculous polymer, that when coated on any vehicle, was the equivalent of 30 inches of steel. With bloody conflicts surging in Iraq and Afghanistan, the polymer promises to save thousands of lives and change the course of both wars. Jack Wiley, a successful Wall Street banker, believes he has a found a dream come true when he mysteriously learns of this miraculous polymer. His plan: enlist the help of the Capitol Group, one of the country’s largest and most powerful corporations in a quick, bloodless takeover of the small company that developed the polymer. It seems like a partnership made in heaven…until the Pentagon’s investigative service begins nosing around, and the deal turns into a nightmare.

Mercer and his daughter Rebekah continue to fund right-wing political causes behind the scenes today.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Politico\n\n\nPublisher’s Description\nNEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER Shortlisted for the Financial Times/McKinsey Business Book of the Year Award The unbelievable story of a secretive mathematician who pioneered the era of the algorithm–and made $23 billion doing it. Jim Simons is the greatest money maker in modern financial history. No other investor–Warren Buffett, Peter Lynch, Ray Dalio, Steve Cohen, or George Soros–can touch his record. Since 1988, Renaissance’s signature Medallion fund has generated average annual returns of 66 percent. The firm has earned profits of more than $100 billion; Simons is worth twenty-three billion dollars. Drawing on unprecedented access to Simons and dozens of current and former employees, Zuckerman, a veteran Wall Street Journal investigative reporter, tells the gripping story of how a world-class mathematician and former code breaker mastered the market. Simons pioneered a data-driven, algorithmic approach that’s sweeping the world. As Renaissance became a market force, its executives began influencing the world beyond finance. Simons became a major figure in scientific research, education, and liberal politics. Senior executive Robert Mercer is more responsible than anyone else for the Trump presidency, placing Steve Bannon in the campaign and funding Trump’s victorious 2016 effort. Mercer also impacted the campaign behind Brexit. The Man Who Solved the Market is a portrait of a modern-day Midas who remade markets in his own image, but failed to anticipate how his success would impact his firm and his country. It’s also a story of what Simons’s revolution means for the rest of us."

    "text": "The Ideal Team Player: How to Recognize and Cultivate The Three Essential Virtues by Patrick Lencioni\n\n\nI’m a big fan of Patrick Lencioni and have read almost all his books. Most of them are in the form of ‘business fables’ - they have a fictional plot through which a particular model related to management or leadership is presented. Each book typically also has a section where the model is also presented in a more conventional manner. I found the books easy to read and a good way of conveying the message that Lencioni is trying to deliver. It’s perhaps not everyone’s cup-of-tea, but it works for me.\nThe Ideal Team Player is perhaps not his best work, but nevertheless a worthwhile read with some interesting points to make. I wouldn’t start here if you are coming fresh to Lencioni (I would recommend trying Five Dysfunctions of Team first) but if you have read his other books, you’ll likely enjoy this too.\n\nModel\n\nThe Three Virtues\n\nHumility: Humility is the single most important attribute of a team player. Great team players lack excessive ego or concerns about status. The share credit, emphasize team over self, and define success collectively rather than individually.\nHunger: Hungry people almost never need to be pushed by a manager to work harder because they are self-motivated and diligent.\nPeople Smarts: Smart refers to a person’s common sense about people. It is the ability to be interpersonally approriate and aware.\n\nAn ideal team player has all three virtues combined. If even one virtue is missing, teamwork becomes much more difficult if not impossible.\n\nHumble only: The Pawn\nHungry only: The Bulldozer\nSmart only: The Charmer\nHungry and Humble, but not Smart: The Accidental Mess-Maker\nHumble and Smart, but not Hungry: The Lovable Slacker\nHungry and Smart, but not Humble: The Skillful Politician"

    "text": "The Central Thesis: Hierarchies vs. Networks\n\nNiall Ferguson argues that human history is defined by the tension between two organizational forms: the hierarchy (the “Tower”) and the network (the “Square”).\nHierarchies are vertically structured, centralized, and specialized. They are designed for order and command control (e.g., the Catholic Church, the nation-state, armies).\nNetworks are horizontally structured, distributed, and informal. They are designed for innovation and the rapid dissemination of ideas (e.g., the Reformation, the Illuminati, Silicon Valley).\nFerguson posits that historians have traditionally focused on hierarchies because they leave behind organized archives. Networks, being informal and fluid, often leave “thin” historical records and are consequently underestimated in historical analysis.\n\n\n“Hierarchies have a vital strategic advantage over networks: they are much better at mobilizing resources.” (p. 25)"

Ferguson defines key terms such as “nodes” (individual actors), “edges” (relationships), “hubs” (highly connected nodes), and “weak ties” (connections that bridge different clusters of people).\nHe argues that the power of a network depends on its structure. A network with high “betweenness centrality” allows a specific node to act as a bridge or gatekeeper between otherwise disconnected groups.\nThe author challenges the popular notion that “it’s not what you know, it’s who you know,” refining it to: “It’s not just who you know, but where you are in the network.”"

But we have also created a mechanism for the dissemination of disinformation.” (p. 428)"

He warns that society suffers from an ever-widening gap between firsthand knowledge and decision making—a gap that threatens not only our economic and political efficiency, but our very freedom because actual knowledge gets replaced by assumptions based on an abstract and elitist social vision f what ought to be.Knowledge and Decisions, a winner of the 1980 Law and Economics Center Prize, was heralded as a ”landmark work” and selected for this prize ”because of its cogent contribution to our understanding of the differences between the market process and the process of government.” In announcing the award, the center acclaimed Sowell, whose ”contribution to our understanding of the process of regulation alone would make the book important, but in reemphasizing the diversity and efficiency that the market makes possible, [his] work goes deeper and becomes even more significant.”"

    "text": "Turn the Ship Around!: A True Story of Turning Followers into Leaders by L. David Marquet\n\n\nisbn-13: 9781591846406\nKindle\nPublisher’s Description\n“One of the 12 best business books of all time…. Timeless principles of empowering leadership.” – USA Today “The best how-to manual anywhere for managers on delegating, training, and driving flawless execution.” —FORTUNE Since Turn the Ship Around! was published in 2013, hundreds of thousands of readers have been inspired by former Navy captain David Marquet’s true story. Many have applied his insights to their own organizations, creating workplaces where everyone takes responsibility for his or her actions, where followers grow to become leaders, and where happier teams drive dramatically better results. Marquet was a Naval Academy graduate and an experienced officer when selected for submarine command. Trained to give orders in the traditional model of “know all–tell all” leadership, he faced a new wrinkle when he was shifted to the Santa Fe, a nuclear-powered submarine. Facing the high-stress environment of a sub where there’s little margin for error, he was determined to reverse the trends he found on the Santa Fe: poor morale, poor performance, and the worst retention rate in the fleet. Almost immediately, Marquet ran into trouble when he unknowingly gave an impossible order, and his crew tried to follow it anyway. When he asked why, the answer was: “Because you told me to.” Marquet realized that while he had been trained for a different submarine, his crew had been trained to do what they were told—a deadly combination. That’s when Marquet flipped the leadership model on its head and pushed for leadership at every level. Turn the Ship Around! reveals how the Santa Fe skyrocketed from worst to first in the fleet by challenging the U.S. Navy’s traditional leader-follower approach. Struggling against his own instincts to take control, he instead achieved the vastly more powerful model of giving control to his subordinates, and creating leaders. Before long, each member of Marquet’s crew became a leader and assumed responsibility for everything he did, from clerical tasks to crucial combat decisions. The crew became completely engaged, contributing their full intellectual capacity every day. The Santa Fe set records for performance, morale, and retention. And over the next decade, a highly disproportionate number of the officers of the Santa Fe were selected to become submarine commanders. Whether you need a major change of course or just a tweak of the rudder, you can apply Marquet’s methods to turn your own ship around."

I bought it on a whim during one of Audible’s $5 sales and was afraid it would just be another regurgitation of bland common sense marketed as a new self-improvement breakthrough.\nHowever, I was pleasantly surprised that there was actually some useful takeaways from this book. The author, Steve Herz, has been an agent and coach for sports, media and entertainment leaders and brings a slightly different perspective to self-improvement.\nThe basic message of the books boils down to the acronym AWE - standing for Authority, Warmth and Energy.\nThe author argues that your non-technical skills and Emotional Intelligence (EQ) is what sets succesful people apart.

    "text": "Creativity, Inc. - Overcoming The Unseen Forces That Stand In The Way Of True Inspiration by Ed Catmull, Amy Wallace\n\n\nisbn-13: 9780812993011\nAudible\nPublisher’s Description: “From a co-founder of Pixar Animation Studios—the Academy Award–winning studio behind Coco, Inside Out, and Toy Story—comes an incisive book about creativity in business and leadership for readers of Daniel Pink, Tom Peters, and Chip and Dan Heath. NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER | NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY The Huffington Post • Financial Times • Success • Inc. • Library Journal Creativity, Inc. is a manual for anyone who strives for originality and the first-ever, all-access trip into the nerve center of Pixar Animation—into the meetings, postmortems, and “Braintrust” sessions where some of the most successful films in history are made. It is, at heart, a book about creativity—but it is also, as Pixar co-founder and president Ed Catmull writes, “an expression of the ideas that I believe make the best in us possible.” For nearly twenty years, Pixar has dominated the world of animation, producing such beloved films as the Toy Story trilogy, Monsters, Inc., Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Up, WALL-E, and Inside Out, which have gone on to set box-office records and garner thirty Academy Awards. The joyousness of the storytelling, the inventive plots, the emotional authenticity: In some ways, Pixar movies are an object lesson in what creativity really is. Here, in this book, Catmull reveals the ideals and techniques that have made Pixar so widely admired—and so profitable. As a young man, Ed Catmull had a dream: to make the first computer-animated movie. He nurtured that dream as a Ph.D. student at the University of Utah, where many computer science pioneers got their start, and then forged a partnership with George Lucas that led, indirectly, to his co-founding Pixar in 1986. Nine years later, Toy Story was released, changing animation forever. The essential ingredient in that movie’s success—and in the thirteen movies that followed—was the unique environment that Catmull and his colleagues built at Pixar, based on leadership and management philosophies that protect the creative process and defy convention, such as: • Give a good idea to a mediocre team, and they will screw it up. But give a mediocre idea to a great team, and they will either fix it or come up with something better. • If you don’t strive to uncover what is unseen and understand its nature, you will be ill prepared to lead. • It’s not the manager’s job to prevent risks. It’s the manager’s job to make it safe for others to take them. • The cost of preventing errors is often far greater than the cost of fixing them. • A company’s communication structure should not mirror its organizational structure. Everybody should be able to talk to anybody.”"

Proud, grateful, and longing to be American, the Jews of the Sitka District have created their own little world in the Alaskan panhandle, a vibrant, gritty, soulful, and complex frontier city that moves to the music of Yiddish. For sixty years they have been left alone, neglected and half-forgotten in a backwater of history. Now the District is set to revert to Alaskan control, and their dream is coming to an end: once again the tides of history threaten to sweep them up and carry them off into the unknown. But homicide detective Meyer Landsman of the District Police has enough problems without worrying about the upcoming Reversion. His life is a shambles, his marriage a wreck, his career a disaster. He and his half-Tlingit partner, Berko Shemets, can’t catch a break in any of their outstanding cases. Landsman’s new supervisor is the love of his life—and also his worst nightmare. And in the cheap hotel where he has washed up, someone has just committed a murder—right under Landsman’s nose. Out of habit, obligation, and a mysterious sense that it somehow offers him a shot at redeeming himself, Landsman begins to investigate the killing of his neighbor, a former chess prodigy. But when word comes down from on high that the case is to be dropped immediately, Landsman soon finds himself contending with all the powerful forces of faith, obsession, hopefulness, evil, and salvation that are his heritage—and with the unfinished business of his marriage to Bina Gelbfish, the one person who understands his darkest fears. At once a gripping whodunit, a love story, an homage to 1940s noir, and an exploration of the mysteries of exile and redemption, The Yiddish Policemen’s Union is a novel only Michael Chabon could have written.”"

    "section": "Introduction",
    "text": "Introduction\nCrime and Punishment, first published in twelve monthly installments in the literary journal The Russian Messenger in 1866, stands as one of the definitive works of Russian literature. Written by Fyodor Dostoevsky during a period of immense social and political upheaval following the emancipation of the serfs, the novel reflects the chaotic ideological landscape of 19th-century Russia. This 1914 translation by Constance Garnett played a pivotal role in introducing Dostoevsky to the Western world, offering a smooth, Victorian prose style that, while occasionally smoothing over the author’s rougher edges, was adored by early modernists like Ernest Hemingway [1][4].\nSet in the sweltering, claustrophobic atmosphere of St. Petersburg, the novel serves as a critique of radical new theories such as “Nihilism” and “Utilitarianism” that were gaining traction at the time. It is widely considered one of the first psychological novels, marking a significant shift in literature by focusing less on the external details of a crime and more on the internal, spiritual torment of the criminal [3]."

    "text": "Overview of the story\nThe narrative follows Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov, a destitute former student living in a tiny, coffin-like garret in St. Petersburg. Driven by poverty and a feverish belief in a “Superman” theory—that extraordinary individuals have the right to transgress moral laws for the greater good—he brutally murders an unscrupulous elderly pawnbroker, Alyona Ivanovna, with an axe. In the panic of the act, he is forced to also kill her gentle, innocent sister, Lizaveta, who stumbles upon the scene. Raskolnikov steals a small purse and trinkets but buries them under a rock without ever using them, proving to himself that his motivation was ideological rather than financial [5].\nFollowing the murder, the novel details the intense psychological cat-and-mouse game that ensues. Raskolnikov descends into a delirious state, oscillating between arrogance and paranoia. He is pursued by the cunning investigator Porfiry Petrovich, who suspects Raskolnikov but lacks concrete proof, relying instead on psychological pressure to force a confession. As Raskolnikov becomes increasingly isolated by his guilt, he finds himself drawn to Sonya Marmeladov, a young woman forced into prostitution to support her starving family. Meanwhile, his sister Dunya arrives in the city, pursued by two suitors: the wealthy, calculating Luzhin and the depraved Svidrigailov [2][5].\nThe pressure mounts until Svidrigailov, who knows Raskolnikov’s secret, commits suicide after being rejected by Dunya. Realizing his theory has failed because he is crushed by guilt—proving he is “ordinary”—Raskolnikov visits Sonya. She urges him to confess and “accept his suffering” to achieve redemption. In the epilogue, Raskolnikov confesses and is sentenced to eight years of hard labor in Siberia. Sonya follows him, and it is there, after a long period of spiritual resistance, that he finally undergoes an awakening, realizing that love and humility offer the only true path to life [5]."

She mirrors her brother’s willingness to sacrifice herself, intending to marry the wealthy Luzhin to save her family from poverty—a sacrifice Raskolnikov violently rejects [2].\nArkady Svidrigailov: Dunya’s former employer and a wealthy, depraved nihilist. He acts as a dark “double” to Raskolnikov, showing the end result of a man who has truly “stepped over” all moral lines. His path leads only to emptiness and suicide [2].\nPorfiry Petrovich: The sharp investigator who understands Raskolnikov’s psyche perfectly. He acts as both a tormentor and a mentor, urging Raskolnikov to confess not just to solve the case, but to save his own soul [2].\nDmitri Razumihin: Raskolnikov’s loyal friend. He serves as a foil to the protagonist—though also poor and struggling, he remains cheerful, hardworking, and connected to humanity [2]."

    "title": "Crime and Punishment",
    "section": "Overview of the themes",
    "text": "Overview of the themes\nThe novel explores several profound themes, most notably the “Superman” (Übermensch) theory. Raskolnikov’s central idea that great men are above moral law is systematically dismantled, showing that such isolation leads to madness rather than greatness. Dostoevsky uses this to critique the Nihilism and Utilitarianism of 1860s Russian radicalism, arguing that logic alone cannot justify human actions and often leads to monstrous conclusions [3].\nAlienation is another central theme; the act of murder physically and spiritually separates Raskolnikov from humanity. He finds he cannot endure the company of his mother or sister while carrying his secret. Reconnection is only possible through confession and the acceptance of punishment. This ties into the theme of redemption through suffering, a distinctly Russian Orthodox concept. The “punishment” in the title refers less to the legal prison sentence and more to the internal psychological disintegration that precedes it. Raskolnikov cannot simply be “rehabilitated”; he must suffer to purge his guilt, a path illuminated by Sonya [3]."

It laid the groundwork for Existentialism, influencing thinkers like Friedrich Nietzsche and Albert Camus [6]. Its deep exploration of the psychology of crime, the limits of rationalism, and the possibility of redemption has cemented its status as a timeless classic. It remains a definitive argument that human nature cannot be reduced to mathematical formulas, and that the path to salvation often lies through suffering [3]."

Renée Ballard and the LAPD’s Open-Unsolved Unit get a hot shot DNA connection between a recently arrested man and a serial rapist and murderer who went quiet twenty years ago. The arrested man is only twenty-three, so the genetic link must be familial. It is his father who was the Pillowcase Rapist, responsible for a five-year reign of terror in the city of angels. But when Ballard and her team move in on their suspect, they encounter a baffling web of secrets and legal hurdles. Meanwhile, Ballard’s badge, gun, and ID are stolen–a theft she can’t report without giving her enemies in the department the ammunition they need to end her career as a detective. She works the burglary alone, but her solo mission leads her into greater danger than she anticipates. She has no choice but to go outside the department for help, and that leads her to the door of Harry Bosch. Finally, Ballard takes on a new volunteer to the cold case unit. Bosch’s daughter Maddie wants to supplement her work as a patrol officer on the night beat by investigating cases with Ballard.

Our stories are vivid, detailed, and convincing. These aren’t the stories we tell around the watercooler or the campfire. They are the stories we tell ourselves—the ones that rattle around in our heads and move us to emotions and actions. If we don’t pay attention, these stories can take us down the victim path—blaming, frustrated, helpless, and hopeless. But at any moment, we have the power to identify and change these stories. We can choose the right stories—the ones that enable us to become “Everyday Heroes.” Be the Hero brings to life the entertaining tale of a struggling young professional who moves from victim to hero by learning to become aware of and change the stories that are holding him back. Battling negativity, inertia, and anger, he learns to see life through a new lens, to create new hero stories that develop his capacity to chart his own course. The powerful resources at the end of the book, including a hero tip of the week, smart cards, manager tip sheets, and more, will help you make your hero stories stick. This simple parable will change your life forever.”"

Save for one thing: the Civil War never occurred. A gifted young black man calling himself Victor has struck a bargain with federal law enforcement, working as a bounty hunter for the US Marshall Service. He’s got plenty of work. In this version of America, slavery continues in four states called”the Hard Four.” On the trail of a runaway known as Jackdaw, Victor arrives in Indianapolis knowing that something isn’t right–with the case file, with his work, and with the country itself. A mystery to himself, Victor suppresses his memories of his childhood on a plantation, and works to infiltrate the local cell of a abolitionist movement called the Underground Airlines. Tracking Jackdaw through the back rooms of churches, empty parking garages, hotels, and medical offices, Victor believes he’s hot on the trail. But his strange, increasingly uncanny pursuit is complicated by a boss who won’t reveal the extraodinary stakes of Jackdaw’s case, as well as by a heartbreaking young woman and her child who may be Victor’s salvation. Victor himself may be the biggest obstacle of all–though his true self remains buried, it threatens to surface. Victor believes himself to be a good man doing bad work, unwilling to give up the freedom he has worked so hard to earn. But in pursuing Jackdaw, Victor discovers secrets at the core of the country’s arrangement with the Hard Four, secrets the government will preserve at any cost. Underground Airlines is a ground-breaking novel, a wickedly imaginative thriller, and a story of an America that is more like our own than we’d like to believe.”"

    "text": "Range by David Epstein\n\n\nisbn-13: 9780735214484\nAudible\nPublisher’s Description:\n“Shares counterintuitive advice on the most effective path to success in any domain while revealing the essential contributions of generalist, not specialist, team members”\nQuotes\n\nEventual elites typically devote less time early on to deliberate practice in the activity in which they will eventually become experts. Instead, they undergo what researchers call a “sampling period.” They play a variety of sports, usually in an unstructured or lightly structured environment; they gain a range of physical proficiencies from which they can draw; they learn about their own abilities and proclivities; and only later do they focus in and ramp up technical practice in one area.\n\n\nI dove into work showing that highly credentialed experts can become so narrow-minded that they actually get worse with experience, even while becoming more confident—a dangerous combination. And I was stunned when cognitive psychologists I spoke with led me to an enormous and too often ignored body of work demonstrating that learning itself is best done slowly to accumulate lasting knowledge, even when that means performing poorly on tests of immediate progress. That is, the most effective learning looks inefficient; it looks like falling behind.\n\n\nincreasing specialization has created a “system of parallel trenches” in the quest for innovation. Everyone is digging deeper into their own trench and rarely standing up to look in the next trench over, even though the solution to their problem happens to reside there.\n\n\nThe challenge we all face is how to maintain the benefits of breadth, diverse experience, interdisciplinary thinking, and delayed concentration in a world that increasingly incentivizes, even demands, hyperspecialization.\n\n\nThe bestseller Talent Is Overrated used the Polgar sisters and Tiger Woods as proof that a head start in deliberate practice is the key to success in “virtually any activity that matters to you.” The powerful lesson is that anything in the world can be conquered in the same way. It relies on one very important, and very unspoken, assumption: that chess and golf are representative examples of all the activities that matter to you.\n\n\nIt was a wide-ranging review of research that rocked psychology because it showed experience simply did not create skill in a wide range of real-world scenarios, from college administrators assessing student potential to psychiatrists predicting patient performance to human resources professionals deciding who will succeed in job training. In those domains, which involved human behavior and where patterns did not clearly repeat, repetition did not cause learning. Chess, golf, and firefighting are exceptions, not the rule.\n\n\nIn 2009, Kahneman and Klein took the unusual step of coauthoring a paper in which they laid out their views and sought common ground. And they found it. Whether or not experience inevitably led to expertise, they agreed, depended entirely on the domain in question. Narrow experience made for better chess and poker players and firefighters, but not for better predictors of financial or political trends, or of how employees or patients would perform.\n\n\nThe domains Klein studied, in which instinctive pattern recognition worked powerfully, are what psychologist Robin Hogarth termed “kind” learning environments. Patterns repeat over and over, and feedback is extremely accurate and usually very rapid. In golf or chess, a ball or piece is moved according to rules and within defined boundaries, a consequence is quickly apparent, and similar challenges occur repeatedly.\n\n\nKahneman was focused on the flip side of kind learning environments; Hogarth called them “wicked.” In wicked domains, the rules of the game are often unclear or incomplete, there may or may not be repetitive patterns and they may not be obvious, and feedback is often delayed, inaccurate, or both.\n\n\nOur greatest strength is the exact opposite of narrow specialization. It is the ability to integrate broadly.\n\n\n“AI systems are like savants.” They need stable structures and narrow worlds.\n\n\nWhen narrow specialization is combined with an unkind domain, the human tendency to rely on experience of familiar patterns can backfire horribly—like the expert firefighters who suddenly make poor choices when faced with a fire in an unfamiliar structure.\n\n\nAll this is bad news for some of the business world’s favorite successful-learning analogies—the Polgars, Tiger, and to some degree analogies based in any sport or game. Compared to golf, a sport like tennis is much more dynamic, with players adjusting to opponents every second, to surfaces, and sometimes to their own teammates. (Federer was a 2008 Olympic gold medalist in doubles.) But tennis is still very much on the kind end of the spectrum compared to, say, a hospital emergency room, where doctors and nurses do not automatically find out what happens to a patient after their encounter. They have to find ways to learn beyond practice, and to assimilate lessons that might even contradict their direct experience. The world is not golf, and most of it isn’t even tennis. As Robin Hogarth put it, much of the world is “Martian tennis.” You can see the players on a court with balls and rackets, but nobody has shared the rules. It is up to you to derive them, and they are subject to change without notice.\n\n\nThe main conclusion of work that took years of studying scientists and engineers, all of whom were regarded by peers as true technical experts, was that those who did not make a creative contribution to their field lacked aesthetic interests outside their narrow area. As psychologist and prominent creativity researcher Dean Keith Simonton observed, “rather than obsessively focus[ing] on a narrow topic,” creative achievers tend to have broad interests. “This breadth often supports insights that cannot be attributed to domain-specific expertise alone.”\n\n\nConnolly’s primary finding was that early in their careers, those who later made successful transitions had broader training and kept multiple “career streams” open even as they pursued a primary specialty. They “traveled on an eight-lane highway,” he wrote, rather than down a single-lane one-way street. They had range. The successful adapters were excellent at taking knowledge from one pursuit and applying it creatively to another, and at avoiding cognitive entrenchment. They employed what Hogarth called a “circuit breaker.” They drew on outside experiences and analogies to interrupt their inclination toward a previous solution that may no longer work. Their skill was in avoiding the same old patterns. In the wicked world, with ill-defined challenges and few rigid rules, range can be a life hack.\n\n\nIn Flynn’s terms, we now see the world through “scientific spectacles.” He means that rather than relying on our own direct experiences, we make sense of reality through classification schemes, using layers of abstract concepts to understand how pieces of information relate to one another.\n\n\nResearch on thousands of adults in six industrializing nations found that exposure to modern work with self-directed problem solving and nonrepetitive challenges was correlated with being “cognitively flexible.”\n\n\nthat modern life requires range, making connections across far-flung domains and ideas. Luria addressed this kind of “categorical” thinking, which Flynn would later style as scientific spectacles. “[It] is usually quite flexible,” Luria wrote. “Subjects readily shift from one attribute to another and construct suitable categories. They classify objects by substance (animals, flowers, tools), materials (wood, metal, glass), size (large, small), and color (light, dark), or other property. The ability to move freely, to shift from one category to another, is one of the chief characteristics of ‘abstract thinking.’”\n\n\nChicago has long prided itself on a core curriculum dedicated to interdisciplinary critical thinking. The two-year core, according to the university, “is intended as an introduction to the tools of inquiry used in every discipline—science, mathematics, humanities, and social sciences. The goal is not just to transfer knowledge, but to raise fundamental questions and to become familiar with the powerful ideas that shape our society.”\n\n\nJeannette Wing, a computer science professor at Columbia University and former corporate vice president of Microsoft Research, has pushed broad “computational thinking” as the mental Swiss Army knife. She advocated that it become as fundamental as reading, even for those who will have nothing to do with computer science or programming. “Computational thinking is using abstraction and decomposition when attacking a large complex task,” she wrote. “It is choosing an appropriate representation for a problem.”\n\n\nLike chess masters and firefighters, premodern villagers relied on things being the same tomorrow as they were yesterday. They were extremely well prepared for what they had experienced before, and extremely poorly equipped for everything else. Their very thinking was highly specialized in a manner that the modern world has been telling us is increasingly obsolete. They were perfectly capable of learning from experience, but failed at learning without experience. And that is what a rapidly changing, wicked world demands—conceptual reasoning skills that can connect new ideas and work across contexts. Faced with any problem they had not directly experienced before, the remote villagers were completely lost. That is not an option for us. The more constrained and repetitive a challenge, the more likely it will be automated, while great rewards will accrue to those who can take conceptual knowledge from one problem or domain and apply it in an entirely new one.\n\n\nThe psychologists highlighted the variety of paths to excellence, but the most common was a sampling period, often lightly structured with some lessons and a breadth of instruments and activities, followed only later by a narrowing of focus, increased structure, and an explosion of practice volume.\n\n\nBut for learning that is both durable (it sticks) and flexible (it can be applied broadly), fast and easy is precisely the problem.\n\n\nKornell was explaining the concept of “desirable difficulties,” obstacles that make learning more challenging, slower, and more frustrating in the short term, but better in the long term.\n\n\nUsed for learning, testing, including self-testing, is a very desirable difficulty. Even testing prior to studying works, at the point when wrong answers are assured.\n\n\nanother important desirable difficulty: “spacing,” or distributed practice. It is what it sounds like—leaving time between practice sessions for the same material. You might call it deliberate not-practicing between bouts of deliberate practice.\n\n\nIn 2007, the U.S. Department of Education published a report by six scientists and an accomplished teacher who were asked to identify learning strategies that truly have scientific backing. Spacing, testing, and using making-connections questions were on the extremely short list. All three impair performance in the short term.\n\n\nPsychologist Robert Bjork first used the phrase “desirable difficulties” in 1994. Twenty years later, he and a coauthor concluded a book chapter on applying the science of learning like this: “Above all, the most basic message is that teachers and students must avoid interpreting current performance as learning. Good performance on a test during the learning process can indicate mastery, but learners and teachers need to be aware that such performance will often index, instead, fast but fleeting progress.”\n\n\nfor knowledge to be flexible, it should be learned under varied conditions, an approach called varied or mixed practice, or, to researchers, “interleaving.” Interleaving has been shown to improve inductive reasoning. When presented with different examples mixed together, students learn to create abstract generalizations that allow them to apply what they learned to material they have never encountered before.\n\n\nDesirable difficulties like testing and spacing make knowledge stick. It becomes durable. Desirable difficulties like making connections and interleaving make knowledge flexible, useful for problems that never appeared in training. All slow down learning and make performance suffer, in the short term.\n\n\nBefore-our-eyes progress reinforces our instinct to do more of the same, but just like the case of the typhoid doctor, the feedback teaches the wrong lesson. Learning deeply means learning slowly. The cult of the head start fails the learners it seeks to serve. Knowledge with enduring utility must be very flexible, composed of mental schemes that can be matched to new problems.\n\n\nWhen a knowledge structure is so flexible that it can be applied effectively even in new domains or extremely novel situations, it is called “far transfer.”\n\n\n“In my opinion,” Gentner told me, “our ability to think relationally is one of the reasons we’re running the planet. Relations are really hard for other species.” Analogical thinking takes the new and makes it familiar, or takes the familiar and puts it in a new light, and allows humans to reason through problems they have never seen in unfamiliar contexts. It also allows us to understand that which we cannot see at all.\n\n\nIn a wicked world, relying upon experience from a single domain is not only limiting, it can be disastrous.\n\n\nThe trouble with using no more than a single analogy, particularly one from a very similar situation, is that it does not help battle the natural impulse to employ the “inside view,” a term coined by psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky. We take the inside view when we make judgments based narrowly on the details of a particular project that are right in front of us.\n\n\nOur natural inclination to take the inside view can be defeated by following analogies to the “outside view.” The outside view probes for deep structural similarities to the current problem in different ones. The outside view is deeply counterintuitive because it requires a decision maker to ignore unique surface features of the current project, on which they are the expert, and instead look outside for structurally similar analogies. It requires a mindset switch from narrow to broad.\n\n\nPsychologists have shown repeatedly that the more internal details an individual can be made to consider, the more extreme their judgment becomes.\n\n\nIn one of the most cited studies of expert problem solving ever conducted, an interdisciplinary team of scientists came to a pretty simple conclusion: successful problem solvers are more able to determine the deep structure of a problem before they proceed to match a strategy to it. Less successful problem solvers are more like most students in the Ambiguous Sorting Task: they mentally classify problems only by superficial, overtly stated features, like the domain context. For the best performers, they wrote, problem solving “begins with the typing of the problem.” As education pioneer John Dewey put it in Logic, The Theory of Inquiry, “a problem well put is half-solved.”\n\n\nIn the late 1960s, future Nobel laureate economist Theodore Schultz argued that his field had done well to show that higher education increased worker productivity, but that economists had neglected the role of education in allowing individuals to delay specialization while sampling and finding out who they are and where they fit.\n\n\nLearning stuff was less important than learning about oneself. Exploration is not just a whimsical luxury of education; it is a central benefit.\n\n\nThe expression “young and foolish,” he wrote, describes the tendency of young adults to gravitate to risky jobs, but it is not foolish at all. It is ideal. They have less experience than older workers, and so the first avenues they should try are those with high risk and reward, and that have high informational value."

Much of the book is about being Muslim in the US and the need for interpersonal dialog between people of different faiths, but there are also a number of powerful storeis here on race and the continuing struggle of African-Americans for equal treatment in the USA.

But anyone who sincerely wants to bridge the gaps in understanding will appreciate this book. Guzmán is emphatic about making an effort to work on difficult conversations.” —Manhattan Book Review We think we have the answers, but we need to be asking a lot more questions. Journalist Mónica Guzmán is the loving liberal daughter of Mexican immigrants who voted—twice—for Donald Trump. When the country could no longer see straight across the political divide, Mónica set out to find what was blinding us and discovered the most eye-opening tool we’re not using: our own built-in curiosity. Partisanship is up, trust is down, and our social media feeds make us sure we’re right and everyone else is ignorant (or worse). But avoiding one another is hurting our relationships and our society. In this timely, personal guide, Mónica, the chief storyteller for the national cross-partisan depolarization organization Braver Angels, takes you to the real front lines of a crisis that threatens to grind America to a halt—broken conversations among confounded people. She shows you how to overcome the fear and certainty that surround us to finally do what only seems impossible: understand and even learn from people in your life whose whole worldview is different from or even opposed to yours. Drawing from cross-partisan conversations she’s had, organized, or witnessed everywhere from the echo chambers on social media to the wheat fields in Oregon to raw, unfiltered fights with her own family on election night, Mónica shows how you can put your natural sense of wonder to work for you immediately, finding the answers you need by talking with people—rather than about them—and asking the questions you want, curiously. In these pages, you’ll learn: How to ask what you really want to know (even if you’re afraid to) How to grow smarter from even the most tense interactions, online or off How to cross boundaries and find common ground—with anyone Whether you’re left, right, center, or not a fan of labels: If you’re ready to fight back against the confusion, heartbreak, and madness of our dangerously divided times—in your own life, at least—Mónica’s got the tools and fresh, surprising insights to prove that seeing where people are coming from isn’t just possible. It’s easier than you think."

If you were the one … to break the biological code? There’s been a breakthrough on the campus of Caltech. A discovery. An invention. One so startling and surprisingly sinister that the inventor can’t tell a soul. Precariously poised at the center of the action is Victoria Pixler, a bioengineering student with a tragic past, a passionate quest, and a brilliant mind. After a decade of dedication, she’s just completed her life’s work only to have her dream shattered and her career terminated—by the least likely suspect. Meanwhile, propelling the thrills from the middle of the mystery is one of humanity’s great questions: Would the power to read minds be a blessing, or a curse? Packed with enlightened anecdotes, amusing quips, and suspense that will rivet readers to their chairs, this novel delivers Tigner’s trademark fast-paced action and first-class intellectual intrigue—from characters you can’t forget.” –Back cover."

    "text": "The Song of the Dodo: Island Biogeography in an Age of Extinctions by David Quammen\n\n\nI read this at it was chosen as the first book for the Farnam Street Blog Virtual Reading Group. It’s unlikely to be something I would have naturally read otherwise, but it turned out to be fascinating read.\nThe book is essentially a tour through the birth of the theory of evolution, through to island biogeography and conservation biology. You get to meet the scientists at the heart of these developments from Alfred Russel Wallace and Charles Darwin, to E.O. Wilson, Jared Diamond and many others. You also get to tour the world from Indonesia to the Galapagos to Madagascar to Tasmania and many other places. You also get to meet many different species of animal, some of which are now extinct and many of which may be on their way. It’s a long book, but never boring.\nThe book is replete with interesting stories. Although almost everyone has heard of the Dodo, another animal mentioned in the book is the Passenger Pigeon. Now extinct, there were 3-5 billion of them in North America in the 18th and 19th centuries, but they became extinct by 1900.\nHaving only ever studied a minimal amount of biology at school, I really only had a shallow understanding of evolution and how new species are created. My understanding is much improved after reading this book, though it has now opened a whole new set of questions for me.\nOne other benefit in reading this book is that you’ll pick up a plethora of new and interesting words for your vocabulary. This is where the Kindle really comes in handy, as you can just highlight a word to bring up the dictionary entry for it. Unfortunately, I didn’t make note of those interesting words as I was reading and can no longer remember any of them - a lesson for the future. Going forwards I will be adding all the interesting words to my notes for the book on the kindle."

    "text": "Introduction\nThe Millionaire Fastlane: Crack the Code to Wealth and Live Rich for a Lifetime! by MJ DeMarco is a financial guide that challenges the traditional advice of “Get Rich Slow.” DeMarco argues that the standard societal prescription—go to school, get a good job, save 10% of your paycheck, and invest in the stock market—is a “Slowlane” roadmap that trades your most valuable asset, time, for a mediocre financial future at an old age. Instead, the book advocates for the “Fastlane,” a strategy focused on entrepreneurship and building business systems that divorce income from time. The core premise is that “Get Rich Quick” is a valid mathematical possibility, distinct from “Get Rich Easy,” and requires a fundamental shift from a consumer mindset to a producer mindset [1, 2]."

    "section": "Overview of the key points",
    "text": "Overview of the key points\n\nThe Three Roadmaps to Wealth\nDeMarco categorizes financial behaviors into three distinct roadmaps, each with its own mathematical formula and destination.\n\nThe Sidewalk: This roadmap describes people who live for today with no financial plan. Sidewalkers seek immediate gratification and spend everything they earn, regardless of their income level. They are often “income rich” but “net worth poor,” living one crisis away from bankruptcy. Their wealth equation is Income + Debt [3].\nThe Slowlane: This is the path most people are taught to follow. It involves sacrificing today for a better tomorrow by relying on a job and market investments. The Slowlane wealth equation is (Job Salary) + (Market Investments). DeMarco critiques this path because its variables—your time and the stock market returns—are limited and uncontrollable. You cannot work more than 24 hours a day, and you cannot control the economy [3, 4].\nThe Fastlane: This roadmap focuses on unlimited wealth creation through business systems. Fastlaners build assets that generate income independent of their time. Their wealth equation is Net Profit + Asset Value. By increasing unit profit or volume (Scale), a Fastlaner can exponentially increase their income and the asset value of their business, often leading to a massive “event” or exit [2, 3].\n\n\n\nThe CENTS Framework\nTo distinguish a true Fastlane business from a job in disguise, DeMarco introduces the CENTS framework. A business must meet these five commandments to have high wealth potential:\n\nControl: You must own and control your business system. Building on someone else’s platform (like solely relying on a third-party marketplace) violates this commandment because you are a “hitchhiker” at the mercy of the driver [2].\nEntry: The barrier to entry must be high. If anyone can start your business in a day, competition will be fierce and margins low. True opportunity lies in businesses that require process and difficulty to start [2].\nNeed: Businesses must solve a genuine problem or fill a need. DeMarco advises against “doing what you love” if the market doesn’t value it; instead, “do what they need” [2, 5].\nTime: The business must be able to operate without your active presence. You must be able to divorce your time from your income through automation and systems [2].\nScale: The business must have the potential to impact millions. Wealth is capped if your reach is limited to a local area. You need magnitude (high value) or scale (high volume) to generate significant wealth [2, 3].\n\n\n\nThe Law of Effection\nDeMarco defines wealth through the “Law of Effection,” which states that to make millions, you must impact millions. Financial success is a direct reflection of the number of lives a person touches. This can be achieved by selling a low-priced product to millions of people (scale) or a high-priced product to fewer people (magnitude) [2, 3]."

    "section": "Overview of the key themes",
    "text": "Overview of the key themes\n\nProducer vs. Consumer Mindset\nA central theme of the book is the necessity of switching from a consumer to a producer. Most people are conditioned to look for things to buy, but wealthy individuals look for needs to fill. DeMarco urges readers to analyze the world through a producer’s lens: instead of just buying a product, ask how the company makes money, what their business model is, and how they provide value [5].\n\n\nProcess vs. Event\nThe book emphasizes that wealth is a process, not an event. Society often celebrates the “event”—the sale of a company or a lottery win—without acknowledging the years of hard work, failure, and execution that preceded it. DeMarco warns that seeking the event without enduring the process leads to failure. Execution is described as the great divider between those who dream of wealth and those who achieve it [5].\n\n\nMathematics over “Miracles”\nDeMarco heavily critiques the reliance on compound interest as a wealth-building tool for the young. He argues that compound interest is effective only with massive capital or massive time (40+ years), making it a “Slowlane” tool. Fastlaners focus on the math of business growth—increasing net profit by large percentages through execution—which instantly increases asset value, offering a far faster route to wealth than waiting for average market returns [3, 4]."

    "section": "Conclusion",
    "text": "Conclusion\nThe Millionaire Fastlane concludes with a call to take responsibility for one’s financial life. DeMarco asserts that the Slowlane is a risky gamble that relies on uncontrollable factors like the economy and the stock market. True financial freedom comes from taking control, building systems that solve genuine needs, and executing on a process that divorces income from time. The final message is to stop trading time for money and start building assets that can generate wealth independently [2, 3]."

    "text": "Key Principles\n\nBias towards single sub-agent: One comprehensive book summary task is more token-efficient than multiple narrow ones\nAvoid premature decomposition: Don’t break “book summary X” into “book summary X overview”, “book summary X techniques”, “book summary X applications” - just use 1 sub-agent for all of X\nParallelize only for clear comparisons: Use multiple sub-agents when comparing distinct aspects of the book"
